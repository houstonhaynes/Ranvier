/// <summary>
/// The shape of the graph, rather than any one node in it. A diamond is the
/// smallest graph that can be wrong rather than merely slow: if the two legs
/// are updated independently, something at the bottom observes a state that
/// never existed — leg A from after the write and leg B from before it. Solid
/// calls avoiding this glitch-freedom, and every test here is a way of asking
/// for it.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Depth is the other axis. A chain of memos is where an off-by-one in the
/// invalidation walk turns into an update that arrives at node 40 and not 41,
/// and where a cutoff either does or does not stop the walk dead.
/// </remarks>
