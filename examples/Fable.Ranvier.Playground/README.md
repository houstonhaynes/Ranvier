# Fable.Ranvier playground

A small browser playground for the experimental `Ranvier.View.Foundation` renderer. The shell and the
demo are component templates; the shell embeds the demo and the Foundation panels through widget
elements, each one a mount with its own commit mode; the Foundation panels also have their own graph.
Ranvier updates text, attributes and DOM properties without rebuilding the tree. Try the counter,
editable name field and unmount/remount button. Select **Use microtasks**, then **Burst +100** to
exercise coalescing. **Flush DOM** commits queued work explicitly. Changing scheduling mode remounts the demo while preserving its state.
**Burst +100** groups its writes with `Api.batch`; every other listener runs unbatched. The default
synchronous mode commits the final values before the handler returns; the microtask mode defers
subsequent DOM commits.

The Playground project compiles the experimental `Ranvier.View.Foundation` sources from `experiments/`
directly into the app. Its keyed-row panel is mounted with the Foundation representation and
range-mounting APIs; add and reverse rows to exercise reconciliation in the browser. This is an
app-level consumer of the experiment, not a separately packaged library. The project keeps its
`src/Fable.Ranvier` reference for the fixtures under `tests/` that check that library.

## Run

Prerequisites: .NET 10 SDK, Node.js 26 or newer, npm. The repository pins Fable 5.18.0 in its
local .NET tool manifest.

From the repository root:

```powershell
rtk proxy dotnet tool restore
Set-Location examples/Fable.Ranvier.Playground
rtk proxy npm ci
rtk proxy npm run dev
```

Open the localhost URL printed by Vite (normally `http://127.0.0.1:5173`). Edit `App.fs` to change
the demo. The development command compiles once, then runs Fable watch and Vite together. Ctrl+C
stops both. Vite hot reload disposes the old app's mounts and graph before starting a replacement;
hot reload resets app state. The demo's own unmount/remount control preserves its state.

To launch after installation from the repository root:

```powershell
rtk proxy npm --prefix examples/Fable.Ranvier.Playground run dev
```

RTK is the repository's command convention; without it, run the underlying `dotnet`/`npm` commands.

## Build and test

From this directory:

```powershell
rtk proxy npm run build
rtk proxy npx playwright install chromium
rtk proxy npm test
```

`build` compiles F# before Vite bundles it into `dist/`. `test:dom` compiles the F# behavioural
checks and runs them with Node's test runner against jsdom. The test module is imported before
DOM globals are installed to check import safety. `test:browser` compiles the fixtures and app and runs real
Chromium interactions against a separate Vite server on port 5178. It checks output updates,
input node identity/focus/caret, the disabled property, and listener cleanup across remounts.
Scheduling checks cover mutation counts, disposal before commit, setter failures and a synthetic
composition-input echo. Node checks also exercise Pending/Failed invalidation, shared graphs,
setter ownership, reentrant writes and mounting inside a graph batch.
It also edits and restores `App.fs` to verify the Fable watch/Vite cleanup path without reloading
the page. Run the browser suite in a checkout where `App.fs` is not being edited concurrently.
The suites can be run separately with `npm run test:dom` and `npm run test:browser`.

The private npm project pins dependencies in `package-lock.json`. Node 26 is the selected minimum
for the pinned jsdom release; no external server or web API is required.

`rtk proxy npm run bench:dom` measures synchronous versus microtask DOM updates, with and without
core batching, in headless Chromium. It validates output and work counts, saves raw samples and
a report under `docs/.ai/benchmarks/dom-scheduling/`, and closes its own Vite server on port 5179.
See [the benchmark method and results](../../docs/.ai/benchmarks/dom-scheduling/README.md).

## Layout

- `App.fs`: the shell and demo templates and the Foundation keyed-row, component and load-result
  panels.
- `Playground.fsproj`: links Foundation source files before `App.fs` so the app can use them.
- `main.js`: imports the compiled app, registers disposal with Vite and exposes
  `window.playground.dispose`.
- `style.css`: responsive layout and styling.
- `tests/DomChecks.fs`: compiled F# checks of library behaviour.
- `tests/dom.test.mjs`: Node/jsdom setup and test invocation.
- `tests/ScheduledChecks.fs`, `tests/scheduled.test.mjs`: compiled scheduling fixtures and Node checks.
- `tests/scheduled.html`, `tests/scheduled.spec.mjs`: browser scheduling checks.
- `tests/playground.spec.mjs`: real browser interaction checks.

`generated/`, `generated-tests/` and `dist/` are generated and ignored. The Node project references
the local `src/Fable.Ranvier` project, so library edits are part of the Fable watch loop.

## PoC limits

The fixtures under tests/ that exercise src/Fable.Ranvier (DomChecks.fs, ScheduledChecks.fs,
scheduled.html) cover that library: HTML with a static child structure, synchronous state and
optional microtask DOM writes. The queue adds overhead; reduced mutation counts are not a measured
overall speedup. There is no JSX, SSR, hydration or SVG.
The runtime is Ranvier, not Solid; Solid 2's split effects inspired the binding approach.
Pending/error values retain the last successful binding output rather than automatically creating
a loading/error view. See the library README for its ownership and property-setter contracts.

SageFs was used to resolve generated DOM types, and the local Fable.SageFs setup was used for quick
JavaScript-shape experiments. Neither tool is a runtime or build prerequisite for this playground.
