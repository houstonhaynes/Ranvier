/// <para>
/// A dispatch writes the model as a signal write does: readers wake only when the new model differs from the current one
/// under the graph's equality policy, so an <c>update</c> that returns its argument wakes nothing. A write re-runs every
/// observed selector over the model; a selector over another selector's memo re-runs only when that memo changes.

/// An <c>Mvu</c> belongs to the scope current at construction. Once the scope is torn down, at its disposal or before
/// the re-run of the effect or owning memo whose body created the <c>Mvu</c>, <c>Dispatch</c> drops every message
/// unapplied, and the commands of an earlier dispatch that have not yet run are skipped. An <c>Mvu</c> constructed in the
