# Debounce and throttle: design

**Status (2026-10-16):** historical proposal, superseded by the implementation merged in
[#46](https://github.com/shayanhabibi/Ranvier/pull/46). Use the [timing guide](../../content/guide/timing.md)
for the shipped API, injected clock and four timing modes; the proposed signatures below are not current.
The original research deferred this work until after FinishCurrent. Line references below are to
`src/Ranvier/*.fs` at `c631f23`, except those marked "at `b693a42`".
Costs are read from the code; no numbers were measured. §5 names the benchmarks that check them.

## 1. Goal

Research §1 asks for debounce and throttle (FuncUI#360, Fabulous discussion #1061); §11 asks that any time-based
policy take its time from a replaceable source, so a test advances time instead of sleeping (R3 uses
`FakeTimeProvider`). At the research baseline Ranvier had no timers: no source file referenced `TimeProvider`, `Timer`, `Task.Delay` or
`setTimeout`.

The canonical case: a search box signal, debounced, feeding an async memo under `CancelPrevious`.

## 2. Proposed API

```fsharp
// Api.fs
val debounce : delay: TimeSpan -> source: (unit -> 'T) -> Timed<'T>
val throttle : interval: TimeSpan -> source: (unit -> 'T) -> Timed<'T>

// Types.fs
[<AbstractClass>]
type Clock =
    abstract CreateTimer: callback: (unit -> unit) -> ClockTimer
    static member System: Clock                                    // Threading.Timer on .NET, setTimeout under Fable
#if NET8_0_OR_GREATER
    static member OfTimeProvider: TimeProvider -> Clock            // FakeTimeProvider in .NET tests
#endif
and [<AbstractClass>] ClockTimer =
    abstract Arm: due: TimeSpan -> unit                            // re-arming replaces the pending due time
    abstract Disarm: unit -> unit
    interface IDisposable

type ManualClock() =                                               // portable fake, the timer analogue of ManualDispatcher
    inherit Clock()
    member Advance: TimeSpan -> unit                               // fires every timer due, in due order, inline

type GraphOptions = { ...; Clock: Clock }                          // Default: Clock.System; WithClock
```

`Timed<'T>` is a read-only node: `Value` (tracked), `Peek` (untracked), `Dispose`. Owned by the current owner, like
a memo.

```fsharp
let query = createSignal ""
let settled = debounce (TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds 300.) query.Get
let results = createAsync (fun _ ct -> search settled.Value ct)
```

## 3. Semantics

- **`debounce d`.** Holds the source's value at construction. When the timer fires, `source` runs, tracked, and its
  result is written through the graph's equality cutoff; readers wake only if it moved.
  - A signal read directly by `source` re-arms the timer for `d` on every write, so the fire lands `d` after the last
    write of a burst.
  - A read through a computed node (memo, async memo) re-arms the timer on that node's first change only.
    `Memo.MarkDirty` and `MarkCheck` notify observers on the Clean transition alone (`Core.fs:2544-2564`; `AsyncMemo`
    at `3642-3653`). `Timed` does not pull on Check (§4), so the intermediate node stays Check until the fire, and
    later writes in the window stop at it. The fire then lands `d` after the first change: trailing-throttle timing.
  - The fix is open (§9, question 4): pull the Check in the flush, as an effect does (the intermediate node's work
    returns on every write); document the difference; or restrict `source` to signal reads.
- **`throttle i`** (leading and trailing). A change with no window open schedules a leading run into the flush, as an
  effect's run is scheduled, and opens a window of `i`. The change arrives through `MarkDirty`, inside write
  propagation while an observer set is walked, so running `source` there would re-enter the graph. Changes inside the
  window are owed. At the window's end an owed change runs `source` once and opens the next window; otherwise the
  window closes.
- **Readers see the last settled value while the timer runs.** A reader that wants a spinner from the first keystroke
  compares `settled.Value` against `query.Value`.
- **Exception: a failing `source`.** A fire whose `source` throws fails the node, as a memo body does; its readers see
  the error until the next fire moves it.
- **A pending `source`** keeps the node's last value. The node never reports Pending. The source's later settle
  reaches the node as a change and re-arms the timer.
- **Threads.** The timer callback runs on the clock's thread. It goes through `Graph.Post` (`Core.fs:1450-1459` at
  `b693a42`) and lands in the inbox like a flight completion (`docs/content/concepts/contracts.md:30`). Under
  `ManualDispatcher` it applies on the next pump. A `ManualClock` advanced on the graph thread applies inline.
- **Dispose** disarms and disposes the timer. A callback already posted finds the node disposed and does nothing.

## 4. How it works

`Timed<'T>` is one node that is a computation towards `source` and a source towards its readers, like `Memo`
(`Core.fs:2202`), with one difference: `MarkDirty` and `MarkCheck` (on `Memo`, `Core.fs:2545-2570`; on `AsyncMemo`,
`Core.fs:3642-3659`) arm the timer instead of notifying readers. The node's own value is current between fires, so its
freshness towards readers stays Clean and a read never runs `source`. The node subscribes to its sources eagerly, as an
effect does; an unobserved `Timed` still fires.

A `Check` that later resolves to no change still re-arms the timer; the fire then runs `source`, the cutoff holds, and
nothing wakes. Evaluating `source` on each `Check` instead would put the source's work back on every write, which is
the work debounce exists to skip.

The fire callback and the posted work closure are allocated once per node and reused; `ClockTimer.Arm` on .NET maps
to `ITimer.Change` or `Threading.Timer.Change`, which re-arm without allocating. A fire off the graph thread still
allocates per fire: `Graph.Post` builds `Action this.PumpFromDispatcher` on each call (`Core.fs:1459` at `b693a42`),
and the inbox enqueue and `SynchronizationContext.Post` allocate as well.

Under Fable, `Clock.System` uses `Fable.Core.JS.setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`. `ManualClock` is plain F# (a sorted list
of due timers), so the same test runs on both targets.

## 5. Cost model

**Code that does not use debounce or throttle.**

| Path | Added work |
| --- | --- |
| Write, recompute, flush, flight | None. No existing node changes. |
| Per node | None. |
| Per graph | One reference (`GraphOptions.Clock`) if the clock goes on `GraphOptions`; none if it is a combinator argument. |
| Startup | With the clock on `GraphOptions`, every default graph touches `Clock.System`: `GraphOptions.Default` (`Types.fs:274-280`) is a property that builds a new record on each access. Every app pays the static initialisation once, whether or not it debounces. Small, but not zero. |

**Code that uses them.**

| Path | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Construction | One node (same shape as a `Memo`: observer set, source list, value) plus one timer object and two cached closures. |
| Source write, `debounce` | One `MarkDirty` call on the node plus one timer re-arm. On .NET, `Change` takes the timer queue's lock. Under Fable, `clearTimeout` plus `setTimeout`. |
| Source write, `throttle`, no window open | One scheduled leading run, one flush to run it, one timer arm. |
| Source write, `throttle`, window open | One field write. |
| Fire, on the graph thread | One inline `Graph.Post`, one `source` run, one cutoff comparison, one flush if the value moved. |
| Fire, off the graph thread | As above, plus per fire: one `Action` for the pump (`Graph.Post`), one inbox enqueue and the dispatcher's own post (`SynchronizationContext.Post` allocates). |

The re-arm is the one cost without a precedent in the library: it runs inside write propagation, once per write per
debounced node. Benchmarks that settle it, added to `bench/Ranvier.Benchmarks` as `Timed.fs`:

- `WriteThroughDebounce` vs baseline `WriteThroughMemo`: write a signal read by one `debounce` node (resp. one memo with
  an effect). Measures the per-write re-arm on `Clock.System`; `MemoryDiagnoser` must show zero bytes per write.
- `FireDebounced`: `ManualClock.Advance` past the delay after one write. Measures the fire path.
- The same pair on `Clock.OfTimeProvider TimeProvider.System` (net8.0 and net10.0) to compare the two .NET timers.

## 6. Fable, AOT and target frameworks

- **Fable.** `TimeProvider` does not exist under Fable, so `Clock` is Ranvier's own type and `Clock.OfTimeProvider`
  is `#if !FABLE_COMPILER` as well as `NET8_0_OR_GREATER`. `TimeSpan` compiles to milliseconds. Timers fire on a
  macrotask, after any pending microtask outcome.
- **netstandard2.1.** `System.TimeProvider` is not in netstandard2.1 (`src/Ranvier/Ranvier.fsproj:4` targets
  `net10.0;net8.0;netstandard2.1`). `Clock.System` uses `System.Threading.Timer`, available on all three, so no
  `Microsoft.Bcl.TimeProvider` dependency is added. `OfTimeProvider` exists on net8.0 and net10.0 only.
- **AOT and trim.** Abstract classes and closures; no reflection. Safe.

## 7. Compatibility

- New public types `Clock`, `ClockTimer`, `ManualClock`, `Timed<'T>` and functions `debounce`, `throttle`: additive.
- A `Clock` field on `GraphOptions` changes its constructor
  (`docs/.ai/public-api-baseline.txt:110`) and breaks record-expression construction. Callers of
  `GraphOptions.Default.With...` (`Types.fs:271-298`) are unaffected. Ranvier is unreleased.
- Not a `FlightPolicy` case, so the `FlightPolicy` baseline is unchanged.

## 8. Alternatives

- **A flight policy `Debounce of TimeSpan`.** Rejected. `FlightPolicy` is graph-wide (`Types.fs:260`, read at
  `Core.fs:3344` and `Core.fs:3470`), so every async memo in the graph would share one delay. It also debounces the
  wrong node: the delay belongs upstream of the fetch, where a sync source is shielded too. A memo that wants it gets
  it by reading a `Timed` node.
- **Build from `createSignal` plus `createEffectOn` plus a timer.** Works with public API today and is the fallback
  recipe for docs, but costs two nodes plus a timer per debounced value and a flush per write to run the effect.
- **Clock as a combinator argument** (`debounceWith clock delay source`) instead of a `GraphOptions` field. Non-breaking
  and zero per-graph cost, but every call site in a test has to thread the fake clock; a graph option swaps it once,
  as `Dispatcher` does (`Types.fs:262-267`).
- **`TimeProvider` everywhere.** Rejected: absent under Fable and on netstandard2.1.

Tests (all with `ManualClock`, repeated on the Fable suite; one .NET test with `FakeTimeProvider` off the graph
thread): writes within the window reset the delay; `Advance (d - 1ms)` leaves the old value; the fire wakes readers
once; an unchanged fire wakes nothing; throttle emits leading and trailing values; dispose disarms; a callback posted
off-thread applies on the next pump under `ManualDispatcher`.

## 9. Recommendation

**Do later, as combinators.** It is new surface with its own node type and a timer re-arm on the write path of every
debounced source, so the benchmarks above run first. Ship `FinishCurrent` (the flight-duration throttle) before it;
until then the docs carry the signal-plus-effect recipe.

Questions for the maintainer:

1. Clock on `GraphOptions` (breaking) rather than per call? (yes / no)
2. Debounced node Pending while its timer runs? (yes / no; proposal: no)
3. Ship `throttle` with `debounce`, or `debounce` alone first? (both / debounce)
4. A `source` that reads through a computed node re-arms on its first change only (§3). Pull the Check in the flush,
   document the trailing-throttle timing, or restrict `source` to signal reads? (pull / document / signals)


## Reviewer corrections (applied)

Applied to the body above on `b693a42`:

- Debounce through a computed node fires `d` after the first change, not the last: stated in §3, with the options as
  §9 question 4.
- "Never Pending" against "a pending source suspends the node": a pending source keeps the last value; a failing
  source is the stated exception (§3).
- The throttle leading run is scheduled into the flush, not run inside write propagation; the cost table gains its row
  (§3, §5).
- Per-fire allocations off the graph thread (`Graph.Post`'s `Action`, the enqueue, the dispatcher post) are listed (§4,
  §5).
- The Startup row: every default graph touches `Clock.System` through `GraphOptions.Default` (§5).
- The signal-plus-effect recipe costs two nodes plus a timer (§8).
