# Execution ledger: 2026-10-04-query-mutation.md

**Status (2026-10-16):** merged in [#47](https://github.com/ranvier-org/Ranvier/pull/47).
The ledger below records the pre-merge execution and its test counts; it is not an outstanding task list.
See [Queries and mutations](../../content/guide/queries.md) for the current user guide.

Branch: `feat/query-mutation`. Worktree: `C:/Users/shaya/RiderProjects/Ranvier-query`. Base: `7c672a5`.

Tasks 1–7 are complete: public-API composition, typed query identity and leases,
fetch transitions and generation retirement, staged reconciliation, heterogeneous
FIFO mutations, dictionary workflow, and packaging/documentation/portable gates.
Core source and existing public signatures are unchanged. The original checkout's
user changes remain untouched. No merge, push, deployment, or publication occurred.

## Implementation evidence

- Baseline Release .NET suite: 975 passing cases on each of net8.0 and net10.0.
- Added 32 .NET cases and 29 portable cases covering initial suspension, sharing,
  disposal, stale responses, staging failures, mutations, and the partial dictionary.
- Public sources, dispatch, batching, and ownership were proven in SageFs and
  compiled tests; no core extension was required.
- RED identity tests exposed duplicate requests and missing client cancellation.
  Cancellation reentry exposed an extra request (expected two, observed three).
- Independent review found retained lease payloads and cancellation cleanup gaps;
  both were fixed and covered. Final review reported no remaining blockers.
- Debug exposed malformed generated IL in a nested generic task observer
  (`BadImageFormatException` in a dispatched callback). Extracting a module-private
  observer fixed Debug; Release, Fable, and AOT were rerun on the final code.

## Final verification

- Release untraced: 1007 passed, zero skipped, on each .NET target.
- Release traced and Debug: 1086 passed, six skipped, on each .NET target.
- C# Release: 84 passed on each .NET target.
- Both package variants passed fresh-consumer checks with FSharp.Core 8.0.100
  across net10.0, net8.0, and netstandard2.1.
- All 29 Query cases passed in all four Fable combinations (traced/untraced,
  inline/promise dispatch). Full report gate passed; existing core differences
  remain documented in `docs/.ai/fable-compat.md`. Full counts: untraced inline
  826/844, promise 782/844; traced inline 905/927, promise 856/927; 87 excluded.
- Windows NativeAOT published and its executable reported all checks passed.
  This terminal omits the OS environment variable, so publish used
  `-p:OS=Windows_NT`; no product workaround was added.
- Documentation built, including the recipe and Query API pages. Inherited
  NU1608, esbuild, and external-link warnings remain unchanged.
- XML documentation audit returned zero findings. Comment hygiene, Fantomas,
  and whitespace checks passed. Logs are local in ignored
  `artifacts/query-verification`.

## Execution decisions and limits

- Used a sibling worktree rather than an unignored `.worktrees` directory.
- Combined planned commits into one implementation slice because ownership and
  staged publication share foundations. The tradeoff is a larger review commit.
- Portable tests use controlled completion with an immediate unchecked graph;
  a dedicated guarded manual-dispatch test verifies worker completion visibility.
  Await helpers wait for applied state and bound .NET outcome waits; Fable promises
  lack Task.Result/IsCompleted. Retired-delivery tests retain a short drain delay.
- Trace history deliberately retains published values. Payload collection is
  asserted only in untraced Release; its skip adds one to five existing traced
  allocation skips.
- Stopped the implementation's SageFs session, left the user's daemon running,
  and restored the generated warmup-cache change.
- Application membership, projection, and ordering rules remain explicit. Record
  and list reconstruction remains; normalization, retries, expiry, and automatic
  refetch are outside this release.

## Follow-up: local reconciliation measurement

On 2026-10-05 the user requested a measured comparison with a hand-written update.
Added `QueryReconciliationBenchmarks` using the original three-page record model,
the same list patch, and four setup equivalence checks. A SageFs probe first
confirmed identical accepted records and unchanged initial data. Its session was
stopped after the probe; the user's daemon remains running.

All six full BenchmarkDotNet cases passed. For 10 and 1,000 previews, Query adds
0.420 and 0.531 microseconds respectively. All sizes add 1,856 allocated bytes per
three-query commit. At 10,000 previews the timing intervals overlap; no speedup
is inferred. Raw reports, configuration, scope limits, and reproduction command
are documented in `docs/content/benchmarks/queries.md`. The benchmark excludes
networking, acquisition, mutation queue/tasks, and rendering.

The docs menu now includes the query recipe, generated Query API, and the new
query benchmark page. Release tests were rerun: 1007 passed on each .NET target.

## Follow-up: query ergonomics

The ergonomics review's five concerns are addressed:

- Explicit `AcquireOwned(key, pageOwner)` decouples retained navigation pages from
  temporary view owners. `Acquire(key)` keeps its existing signature. An overloaded
  `Acquire(key, owner)` was rejected because it breaks existing unit-key `Acquire ()`
  calls in F#; the named method avoids that source incompatibility.
- `EnsureAsync` and `RefreshAsync` return accepted values after graph publication.
  Detachable waiters fault on loading failure and cancel on retirement or disposal.
  Disposing one lease does not cancel another lease's waiter or shared request.
- XML docs and guides describe edit factories as deferred descriptions, including
  their loaded, pending-without-data, and absent-entry behavior.
- Mutation docs and the command adapter distinguish client-disposal task cancellation
  from the three mutation outcomes. Reconciliation failure retains the saved receipt;
  cache repair must not repeat a successful write.
- `Define(loader)` supplies default key equality, and `SetIfLoaded(key, value)`
  describes replacement without a redundant updater lambda.

The compiled dictionary example covers independent drafts, partial loading, Back,
Home, adding words, and a save finishing after its editor closes. Tests compile its
actual source. The Fable report now resolves linked sources through their Include
paths. The docs menu includes the new navigation guide and generated API methods.
No existing public signature or core graph source changed.

Fresh verification on 2026-10-05:

- Release untraced: 1020 passed on each .NET target. Traced Release and Debug:
  1099 passed and six existing skips on each target.
- All 13 new ergonomics/navigation cases passed in all four Fable combinations.
  Full report gate passed: untraced inline 839/857, promise 795/857; traced inline
  918/940, promise 869/940. Existing core differences remain documented.
- Fresh package consumers passed for both variants with FSharp.Core 8.0.100.
- NativeAOT publication and executable passed, including awaitable loading,
  explicit ownership disposal, mutation, and shared reconciliation checks.
- The standalone example built without warnings. Documentation built 126 pages;
  generated navigation menu and new API methods were checked. Inherited docs
  dependency, minification, and external-link warnings remain.
- FCS reports the Query project clean and confirms the additive public methods.
  XML audit returned zero findings; Fantomas and whitespace checks passed.
- The owned SageFs session was stopped; the user's daemon remains running.

All six full benchmark cases were rerun on the changed implementation. Query adds
0.476 and 0.687 microseconds at 10 and 1000 previews, and 1976 allocated bytes at
every tested size. At 10000 previews, confidence intervals overlap. Guides and raw
reports now reflect this run. The scope excludes awaiting, network IO, acquisition,
mutation queue/tasks, and rendering. The equality-policy description was corrected:
default record comparison uses identity, not structural list equality.
