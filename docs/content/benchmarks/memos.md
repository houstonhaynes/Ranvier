Memos are pull-based: a read runs them, nothing else does. Two costs therefore matter: the cache hit, which every read pays, and a recomputation, which only a read after invalidation pays. See [Benchmarks](index.md) for configuration, environment and caveats.

## MemoBenchmarks

| Method | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| `CachedRead` | Baseline. An untracked read of a clean memo: close to a field read. |
| `CachedTrackedRead` | The same read, tracked. Nothing is listening, so this adds only the tracking check. |
| `Recompute` | Invalidate, then read: one body run plus re-collection of the memo's dependencies. Tagged `Sentinel`. |

| Method            | Categories    | Mean       | Error     | StdDev    | Op/s            | Ratio         | RatioSD | Allocated | Alloc Ratio |
|------------------ |-------------- |-----------:|----------:|----------:|----------------:|--------------:|--------:|----------:|------------:|
| CachedRead        | Memo          |  0.2169 ns | 0.0152 ns | 0.0142 ns | 4,611,057,105.0 |      baseline |         |         - |          NA |
| CachedTrackedRead | Memo          |  0.4765 ns | 0.0180 ns | 0.0168 ns | 2,098,796,549.2 |  2.21x slower |   0.15x |         - |          NA |
| Recompute         | Sentinel,Memo | 15.5039 ns | 0.2091 ns | 0.1854 ns |    64,499,876.3 | 71.76x slower |   4.44x |         - |          NA |

`CachedRead` is at the resolution limit (see [Reading the results](index.md#reading-the-results)), which is why the ratios in this table carry a large `RatioSD`.

`MemoBenchmarks` also runs each case under every `ThreadAffinity`, set by `Affinity` (`Guarded`, `Unchecked`, `Serialised`), as [`SignalBenchmarks`](signals.md#thread-affinity) does. `Recompute` carries the check twice: on the write and on the stale read. The table above predates the parameter and shows `Guarded` only.

The counter scenario `chain-affinity` covers the same two checks: it writes the head of a four-memo chain and reads the stale tail under each affinity. Figures are retired instructions per operation at commit `e13f159`, .NET 10 with tiered compilation and PGO off (see [Instruction counts](counters.md)):

| Affinity | instr/op | bytes/op | Library counters/op |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `Guarded` | 2,179 | 0 | MemoRecomputes 4 |
| `Unchecked` | 2,177 | 0 | MemoRecomputes 4 |
| `Serialised` | 2,516 | 0 | MemoRecomputes 4 |

`Serialised` adds about 340 instructions per write and read of the chain, about 15 % over `Guarded`; `Unchecked` matches `Guarded` within noise. The timing cases are in the suite for local runs (`dotnet run --project bench/Ranvier.Benchmarks -c Release -- --filter "*MemoBenchmarks*"`) and have no published figure yet. The full report is [`e13f159.md`](https://github.com/shayanhabibi/Ranvier/blob/master/docs/.ai/benchmarks/counters/e13f159.md).

## ChainBenchmarks

A signal followed by a chain of `Depth` memos (1, 4, 16 or 64). This shows how propagation scales with depth.

| Method | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| `WriteThenReadTail` | One write at the head and one read at the tail. Every memo in the chain is invalidated and recomputed exactly once. Tagged `Sentinel`. |
| `ReadTailClean` | The same chain read without an intervening write. Every memo is clean, so only the tail is touched. |

## DiamondBenchmarks

Two paths from one source reconverging on one reader. The shape exists to catch an implementation that recomputes the joining node twice per write, or pairs a value from before the write with one from after it.

| Method | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| `WriteThenRead` | One write to the source followed by one read of the joining node. |

Recorded 2026-09-28. Source: `Ranvier.Benchmarks.Memos.DiamondBenchmarks` at commit `d87920f`.

| Method        | Mean     | Error    | StdDev   | Op/s         | Allocated |
|-------------- |---------:|---------:|---------:|-------------:|----------:|
| WriteThenRead | 45.98 ns | 0.930 ns | 1.142 ns | 21,747,537.4 |         - |

The `Ratio` and `Alloc Ratio` columns, where present, compare each method with the baseline method *of the same class* on the same run. They describe the relative cost of two operations inside Ranvier, not a comparison with any other library.
