> **Preview** — Ranvier is pre-release; its APIs may change.

## CI instruction counts
The Library comparison tab compares retired instructions per operation across engines for the latest CI measurement; the Trends tab follows each scenario across commits. The tab last chosen opens on every benchmark page, and the runtime and metric carry over between tabs.
Choose a runtime, metric or recorded commit, filter scenarios by name, and toggle libraries in the legend.

The trend panels follow each scenario across every recorded commit, one panel per Ranvier variant.
By default each line shows its change since its first record; libraries other than Ranvier are pinned
versions, so their lines mark the run-to-run noise floor. A change since the first record of 5 % or more is set in bold. The Metric control switches between instructions, cycles, allocated bytes, branch misses and CPU time on x64. The shaded band spans the lowest and highest of the five processes behind each median, and a ▲ under the axis marks a commit at which the Ranvier variant’s library counters changed; the readout lists those counters.

The write path is the most frequently executed path in the library. These benchmarks measure reads, writes and the equality cutoff on a single signal. See [Benchmarks](index.md) for configuration, environment and caveats.

## SignalBenchmarks

One `int` signal observed by `Observers` memos (0, 1, 8 or 64).

| Method | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| `Read` | A tracked read with no computation running: the read an outside caller makes. |
| `Peek` | An untracked read. Compared with `Read`, it shows the cost of the tracking check. |
| `Write` | A write that changes the value, so every observer is notified. With 0 observers it is the floor for a write. |
| `WriteCutoff` | A write of an equal value. The equality cutoff stops it, so nothing downstream is touched. |
| `WriteAndPropagate` | A write followed by reading every observer back, so it includes the recomputations the write caused. The difference from `Write` is the cost of propagation. |

## Thread affinity

`SignalBenchmarks` runs each case under every `ThreadAffinity`, set by `Affinity`:

| `Affinity` | Check on a write's entry |
| --- | --- |
| `Guarded` | The default. A thread-id comparison against the graph's owner thread. |
| `Unchecked` | None. |
| `Serialised` | Entry into the graph by the calling thread, which must run on the synchronisation context the graph was constructed on. A second thread entering at once raises. |

The table above predates the parameter and shows `Guarded` only.

The counter scenario `chain-affinity` writes the head of a four-memo chain and reads the tail under each affinity. Figures are retired instructions per operation at commit `e13f159`, .NET 10 with tiered compilation and PGO off (see [Instruction counts](counters.md)):

| Affinity | instr/op | bytes/op | Library counters/op |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `Guarded` | 2,179 | 0 | MemoRecomputes 4 |
| `Unchecked` | 2,177 | 0 | MemoRecomputes 4 |
| `Serialised` | 2,516 | 0 | MemoRecomputes 4 |

`Unchecked` costs the same as `Guarded`: the thread-id comparison is within run-to-run noise. `Serialised` costs about 340 more instructions per write and read of the chain, about 15 % over `Guarded`. The BenchmarkDotNet timing cases for each affinity are in the suite for local runs (`dotnet run --project bench/Ranvier.Benchmarks -c Release -- --filter "*SignalBenchmarks*"`) and have no published figure yet. The full report is [`e13f159.md`](https://github.com/shayanhabibi/Ranvier/blob/master/docs/.ai/benchmarks/counters/e13f159.md).

## EqualityBenchmarks

A reference-typed signal written with a cutoff by identity (the default) or by structural comparison (`StructuralPolicy`). The gap between the rows is the cost of choosing structural equality.

| Method | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| `IdentityCutoff` | Baseline. A write stopped by identity comparison. |
| `StructuralCutoff` | A write of a structurally equal value, stopped by a deep comparison. |
| `StructuralWrite` | A write of a structurally different value under `StructuralPolicy`. |

The `Ratio` and `Alloc Ratio` columns, where present, compare each method with the baseline method *of the same class* on the same run. They describe the relative cost of two operations inside Ranvier, not a comparison with any other library.
