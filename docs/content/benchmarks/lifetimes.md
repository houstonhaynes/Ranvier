> **Preview** — Ranvier is pre-release; its APIs may change.

## CI instruction counts
The chart compares retired instructions per operation across engines for the latest CI measurement.
Choose a runtime or recorded commit, filter scenarios by name, and toggle libraries in the legend.

The trend panels follow each scenario across every recorded commit, one panel per Ranvier variant.
By default each line shows its change since its first record; libraries other than Ranvier are pinned
versions, so their lines mark the run-to-run noise floor. A change since the first record of 5 % or more is set in bold.

Construction and teardown are not the hottest path, but they are the path a UI takes on every mount and unmount, and the one where an owner that only grows would show up as a leak rather than as a slowdown. See [Benchmarks](index.md) for configuration, environment and caveats.

## ConstructionBenchmarks

| Method | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| `CreateSignal` | Baseline. Constructing a signal. |
| `CreateAndDisposeMemo` | Constructing and disposing a memo that reads nothing. |
| `CreateAndDisposeEffect` | Constructing and disposing an effect that reads nothing. |

`CreateAndDisposeSeededMemo` constructs and disposes a memo through the seeded constructor, `Memo (graph, seed, compute)`, which adds one adapter closure over the seed and the compute. It postdates the table below and has no published figure yet; it is in the suite for local runs (`dotnet run --project bench/Ranvier.Benchmarks -c Release -- --filter "*ConstructionBenchmarks*"`).

There is deliberately no create-without-dispose case for memos. A memo attaches itself to its enclosing owner, so one that is never disposed is retained for the life of the graph by design; measuring that would measure garbage collection over a growing child list rather than construction.

## ReadingNodeBenchmarks

The same lifecycle for nodes that read a source, so the dependency edge is part of the cost: linked on the first run, unlinked on disposal.

| Method | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| `CreateAndDisposeReadingEffect` | An effect that reads one signal, created and disposed. |
| `CreateAndDisposeReadingMemo` | A memo that reads one signal, created and disposed. |

## FanOutLifecycleBenchmarks

`Nodes` computations (1, 64 or 1024) on one source, created in a scope and torn down with it. The larger cases cross the observer list's indexing threshold, so they include building and draining that index. Divide by `Nodes` for the cost per node.

| Method | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| `EffectsOnOneSource` | `Nodes` effects reading one signal, created and disposed as a unit. |
| `MemosOnOneSource` | `Nodes` memos reading one signal, created and disposed as a unit. |

## ScopeBenchmarks

A scope with `Children` children (1, 8 or 64): the shape a component mount takes.

| Method | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| `CreateAndDisposeScope` | The scope and its children, created and torn down as a unit. |
| `DisposeChildrenIndividually` | The same children, each disposed on its own rather than through the scope. This checks that an individually disposed child leaves its owner's child list. |

## SizeOfProbe

The shallow size of each node type: the `Allocated` column of an uninitialised instance, which counts the object's own fields and none of the objects they reference. It tracks how a change to a node's fields moves its footprint.

| Method | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `MemoInt` | `Memo<int>` |
| `AsyncMemoInt` | `AsyncMemo<int>` |
| `BoundaryInt` | `Boundary<int>` |
| `Effect` | `Effect` |
| `AsyncSourceInt` | `AsyncSource<int>` |
| `Failure` | `Failure`, the record a failed node holds. |

`SizeOfProbe` has no counter scenario and no published figure yet. It is in the suite for local runs: `dotnet run --project bench/Ranvier.Benchmarks -c Release -- --filter "*SizeOfProbe*"`.

The `Ratio` and `Alloc Ratio` columns, where present, compare each method with the baseline method *of the same class* on the same run. They describe the relative cost of two operations inside Ranvier, not a comparison with any other library.
