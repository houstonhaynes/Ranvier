This page covers how asynchronous work fits into a synchronous, re-runnable dependency graph on .NET. It
explains where tasks enter the graph, what happens to superseded requests, which thread owns the graph, and
what changes on JavaScript through Fable. [Suspension](suspension.md) covers the pending channel itself.

## Async as a property of every computation

[Solid 2's release-candidate async design](https://github.com/solidjs/solid/blob/next/documentation/solid-2.0/05-async-data.md)
allows async values to participate in ordinary computations and propagate pending state to loading
boundaries. Ranvier adopts that pending-channel idea, without claiming identical scheduling or rendering:

- Any memo, effect or boundary becomes Pending when it reads a pending value. It needs no special
  constructor to do so.
- Values that genuinely arrive later come from three kinds of node, all *implemented*:
  - `createAsync` computes the value from a task.
  - `createAsyncSource` is settled by hand.
  - `createStream` and `createStreamFold` publish the latest item of a stream, or a fold of its items,
    and restart the stream when `start`'s reads change; see [Streams](../guide/streams.md).

## Tasks enter at the edge of a body

*Implemented.*

A body that re-runs from the top cannot `await` in the middle of a run. If it did, a re-run would restart
the body while an earlier run was still waiting. Instead, the body *returns* a task, and the engine awaits
it:

```fsharp
let profile =
    createAsync (fun _ (ct: CancellationToken) ->
        let id = userId.Value            // tracked: read before the first await
        fetchUserAsync (id, ct))         // Task<User>; the engine awaits it and marks the memo Pending
```

- `createAsync (compute: Previous<'T> -> CancellationToken -> Task<'T>)` returns an `AsyncMemo<'T>`. It is lazy: the first
  read starts a flight, and the memo is Pending until the task completes. When a source that the body read
  changes, the next read starts a new flight.
- Dependencies are tracked only in the synchronous part of the body, before the first `await` that
  suspends. A signal read after that point is not a dependency, so changing it does not start a new flight.
  Read every input before the first `await`.
- The primitive is `Task<'T>`, not `ValueTask<'T>`, because the engine keeps a flight and may consult it
  again. A `ValueTask` cannot be awaited twice.
- `createAsyncSource<'T> ()` returns an `AsyncSource<'T>` that starts Pending. `Settle value` publishes a
  value, and `Fail exn` publishes a failure. `Settle` applies no equality cutoff: settling the same value
  twice still wakes every reader.

If the body reads a pending source before it returns a task, the async memo waits on that source. No
flight starts until the source settles.

### Superseded flights

*Implemented.*

A new flight supersedes one that is still in progress. The async memo's flight policy controls what happens to
the older flight. `GraphOptions.FlightPolicy` sets it for the graph; `createAsyncWithPolicy` and
`createOwningAsyncWithPolicy` set it for one async memo, and memos with different policies in one graph fly
independently:

| Policy | Old token cancelled | Superseded result discarded | Every result applied |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CancelPrevious` (default) | Yes | Yes | No |
| `KeepLatest` | No | Yes | No |
| `Queue` | No | No | Yes, in the order the flights started |

`FinishCurrent` starts no flight while one is in progress. The flight finishes, and every change during it folds
into one trailing run against the current inputs; the memo stays pending until that run settles.

`Drop` and `DropWhilePending` also start no flight while one is in progress: the change is discarded, and the
settled flight's value stays current. Under `DropWhilePending`, a flight that fails after discarding a change
runs once more against the current inputs instead of publishing its error.

Pass the `CancellationToken` to the I/O that the flight performs. Under `CancelPrevious`, cancellation
is requested for superseded work; the operation must cooperate. This does not guarantee that its I/O or
external side effects stop. JavaScript also has cancellation mechanisms such as `AbortController`;
Ranvier's .NET API supplies the token used by .NET tasks.

Every flight's exception is observed, including a superseded flight's and one raised after its memo or graph
was disposed. `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException` receives none of them.
[Async and pending](../guide/async-memos.md#flight-policy) maps the policies to the names used by R3,
SignalsDotnet and CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.

### Not implemented

*Exploratory.* The following ideas from the design research have not been built:

- an `Async<'T>` adapter for cold, restartable F# async workflows
- a coalescing policy that publishes the finished flight's result before the trailing run (SignalsDotnet
  `ScheduleNext`, R3 `ThrottleFirstLast`); `FinishCurrent` keeps the memo pending until the trailing run settles

Debounce and throttle are implemented as [timed values](../guide/timing.md), with eager capture and delayed
publication. Read a timed value from an async memo to control when requests start, and choose its flight
policy separately. They are no longer exploratory flight-policy proposals.

## Threads and dispatch

*Implemented.*

A JavaScript graph normally runs within one execution context; workers are separate contexts. On .NET,
a task usually completes on the thread pool. Ranvier gives each graph an owning thread and marshals
completions back to it.

- **Ownership.** A graph belongs to the thread that constructed it. Under `ThreadAffinity = Guarded` (the
  default), a signal write, node creation, batch, flush, disposal or stale read from another thread raises
  `InvalidOperationException`, and the error message names both threads. `Unchecked` removes the check when
  every access is known to obey the host's synchronization rules. Fable needs no affinity override: all three
  policies run in its single JavaScript context without .NET thread checks. `Serialised` accepts any thread on the construction context, one at a time; see
  [Hopping synchronisation contexts](#hopping-synchronisation-contexts).
- **Inbox.** Completions from other threads, such as `AsyncSource.Settle` and finished `AsyncMemo` flights,
  go into the graph's inbox. `Graph.Pump ()` applies them in arrival order on the owning thread and then
  flushes effects.
- **Dispatcher.** `GraphOptions.Dispatcher` controls how the owning thread learns that work is waiting:

| `Dispatcher` | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `None`, with a `SynchronizationContext` present at construction | Posts the drain to that context. UI threads in WPF, WinForms and Avalonia work this way with no further setup. |
| `None`, with no `SynchronizationContext` | Uses `ManualDispatcher`. |
| `Some (ManualDispatcher ())` | The inbox fills and is drained when the owning thread calls `graph.Pump ()`. |
| `Some (ImmediateDispatcher ())` | Drains on the thread that posted. Under `Guarded`, an off-thread drain raises and the work stays queued. |

A console app, server or test usually has no `SynchronizationContext`, so it gets `ManualDispatcher`. An
off-thread settle is then visible only after `graph.Pump ()`. A missing pump produces a stall, which is easy
to diagnose, where the alternative is a race, which is not. The same behaviour makes async code
deterministic in tests: the test decides when each flight settles.

A message queue belongs at this boundary, one message per drain. It does not belong between nodes. Inside the
graph, a write settles synchronously before the next line runs.

[Contracts](contracts.md#threading) lists which operations each thread may call and where each kind of work runs.

### Where tracking state lives

Tracking must not follow an `await` into its continuation. Code that resumes after an `await` is outside the
synchronous window in which reads are recorded. For this reason, the tracking context is held by the graph
and scoped to a single run. The ambient graph that the `create*` functions use flows with the async context
of `graph.Activate ()`. A guarded graph is ambient on the activating thread only, so code on another thread
must activate a graph before it creates nodes. An activation inside an async body is invisible to other work
on the activating thread while the body is suspended.

### Hopping synchronisation contexts

*Implemented.* A Blazor Server circuit serialises work but runs it on different pool threads. Under
`Guarded`, a graph owned by one of those threads rejects writes that arrive on the next one. Under
`Unchecked`, the writes land but the thread check is gone. `ThreadAffinity.Serialised` accepts an entry from
any thread on the context captured at construction, and raises when a second thread enters while one is
inside the graph. Settles and dispatched work from outside the graph are queued to the context, so they run
serialised with rendering. Activation flows with the execution context, as under `Unchecked`.
[Contracts](contracts.md#serialised-hosts) lists the rules, and [Blazor Server](../guide/blazor-server.md)
shows one graph per circuit. Blazor WebAssembly is single-threaded and works under the default.

## Ownership and disposal

*Implemented.*

A pending node has to outlive the loss of its last subscriber, or its flight would complete into a
disposed node. On .NET, an in-flight task also holds a strong reference to the node. Teardown is therefore
deterministic:

- Owned computations belong to an owner scope. `createRoot` creates a scope, and disposing it disposes
  the owned nodes under it. Signals and async sources are unowned.
- Disposing an async memo cancels its flight's token.
- A node that is Pending when it is disposed becomes Failed with `ObjectDisposedException`, so nothing waits
  on it indefinitely.

[Contracts](contracts.md#ownership) gives the owner of each node an API returns, and of each node created inside a
computation.

## One source, two targets

The core is written in F# that compiles both on .NET and through Fable to JavaScript. It shares the graph
model, with platform-specific implementations and some construction-time `GraphOptions`. Important
differences include:

- **Equality.** The default `JsIdentityPolicy` matches JavaScript's `===`. It compares primitives and
  strings by value and reference types by reference. On .NET it compares other value types by value, and
  `float` uses IEEE equality, so a `nan` write is not cut off. `StructuralPolicy` uses structural equality
  where a native build wants it.
- **Exceptions.** Suspension uses a throw on both targets, so user code looks the same on both. This is one
  more reason resumable code was rejected: Fable cannot compile it, so it would have produced code that
  builds on one target and not on the other.
- **Threads.** A Fable graph runs in one JavaScript execution context and ignores the .NET dispatcher machinery.

The Fable target is implemented; see [Fable (JavaScript) target](../fable/index.md). On the browser, Solid's own signals (through Partas.Solid) are the natural choice for
rendering in Partas.Solid applications. Ranvier can also serve other consumers of a shared .NET/Fable model. See
[Ecosystem](ecosystem.md).

## Outside the scope of the core

Ranvier is a reactive core, not a UI framework. It has no DOM layer and no template compiler. In Solid, a
compiler that extracts templates provides the fine-grained DOM performance, and that is a separate and much
larger body of work than the graph. On native .NET hosts such as Avalonia, WPF, MAUI and Blazor, the host
toolkit does the rendering, so that work does not arise.
