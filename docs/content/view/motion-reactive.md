description: "Ranvier.Anime.Reactive: animations reverted by owners, playback as memos, signals that seek and drive, and the reduced-motion policy."
---

`Ranvier.Anime.Reactive` connects anime objects to owners and signals. It works with the core
without the view layer. Use the opens from [Animation](motion.md#animating-an-element) plus
`open global.Ranvier`.

```fsharp
open global.Ranvier
open Fable.Core
open Ranvier.Anime

/// Fades the panel in, marks it shown once the fade completes, and scales the bar with the level.
let animatePanel (panel: TS.Dom.Element) (bar: TS.Dom.Element) (level: Signal<float>) (shown: Signal<bool>) =
    let fade =
        Reactive.own (Anime.animate (panel, Anim (opacity = Value.fromTo (0, 1), duration = 600)))

    let playback = Reactive.track fade
    Api.createEffect (fun () -> if playback.Completed.Value then shown.Value <- true)

    let fill =
        Reactive.own (Anime.animatable (bar, AnimatableParams (scaleX = 400, ease = Ease.outQuart)))

    Reactive.drive (fun () -> level.Value) fill "scaleX"
```

The panel fades from transparent to opaque over 600 ms; completion sets `shown` to `true`.
Changing `level` sends the bar towards its new scale. Disposing the owner restores both elements
and stops the reactive work.

## `own`

`Reactive.own revertible` registers `revertible.revert ()` as a cleanup of the current owner and
returns `revertible`. It takes any `IRevertible`: an animation, a timeline, an animatable, a
draggable, a scroll observer, a layout, a text splitter or a scope. Outside every root, the owner is
the graph's own scope, which reverts the object when the graph is disposed.

`revert` stops the object and restores the inline styles and attributes it changed.

## `track`

`Reactive.track tickable` returns the tickable's playback as memos:

| Field | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `Progress: Memo<float>` | the overall progress in 0..1 |
| `Running: Memo<bool>` | whether the tickable is playing and not completed |
| `Completed: Memo<bool>` | whether the tickable has completed |

The memos are written from the tickable's `onBegin`, `onUpdate`, `onLoop`, `onPause` and
`onComplete` callbacks, in one batch per callback. A callback the tickable already had still runs,
first. When the owner is disposed, each callback slot that still holds `track`'s chain gets back its
earlier callback; a slot assigned after `track` keeps its new callback.

## `scrub`

```fsharp
let scrubbed (stage: TS.Dom.Element) (position: Signal<float>) =
    let tour =
        Reactive.own (
            Anime
                .timeline(TimelineParams (autoplay = false))
                .add(stage, Anim (x = Value.fromTo (0, 240), duration = 1000))
                .add(stage, Anim (rotate = 90, duration = 500))
        )

    Reactive.scrub (fun () -> position.Value) tour
```

`Reactive.scrub read tickable` is an effect that sets the tickable's `progress` to `read ()`, in
0..1, once with the current value and then whenever it changes. A tickable created with `autoplay = false` seeks to the first value and then follows each change of the
value, so a range input bound to the signal seeks the timeline.

## `drive`

`Reactive.drive read animatable property` is an effect that animates `property` of the animatable to
`read ()`, once with the current value and then whenever it changes, with the property's duration and ease. The animation starts from
the property's current value, so a change while a previous one plays continues from where it is.

## Typed CSS variables

Use `Motion.followCss variable parameters read` as a view attribute to animate a typed custom
property. The reader returns a numeric CSS token such as `Css.px target.Value`; use the existing
`AnimatableProp(duration = 300., ease = Ease.outQuart)` for timing. The first value is set immediately,
and subsequent changes animate from the current value. The part participates in Motion's exit
lifecycle and restores the original inline value and priority on ordinary disposal.

For code with direct element access, `Reactive.driveCss read element variable parameters` owns
the same animation through the current Ranvier owner. `Anim.With(variable, start, finish)` and
`Anim.With(variable, frames)` also work with `Motion.on`, enters and timelines. Each endpoint keeps
the custom property's grammar marker; numeric tokens in an animation must share a unit suffix.

Let [typed CSS expressions](https://ranvier-org.github.io/Ranvier.Css/view/css/#numeric-expressions) consume the variable. The browser updates
every dependent declaration, including pseudo-elements, as Anime writes the variable. Frames
bypass signals. Compound expressions are CSS inputs rather than numeric animation endpoints.
See the [complete component example](https://github.com/ranvier-org/Ranvier/blob/master/docs/samples/css-anime/Example.fs).

## `policy`

```fsharp
let honoured (card: TS.Dom.Element) =
    let duration = if (Reactive.policy ()).Value = Reactive.Reduced then 0 else 400
    Anime.animate (card, Anim (opacity = Value.fromTo (0, 1), duration = duration))
```

`Reactive.policy ()` is the motion policy of the current graph, a `Signal<MotionPolicy>`:

- `Full` or `Reduced`, seeded from `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` on the first call and written
  on each change of the media query.
- Every call on a graph returns the same signal. A write overrides the media query until its next
  change, which makes the policy a user setting as well as a system one.
- Disposing the graph detaches the media query listener.
- Without `matchMedia`, as on .NET and in jsdom, the seed is `Full`.
- The first call on a graph runs outside pure derivations, as `onCleanup` does.

The Motion parts read the policy: under `Reduced`, enters and FLIP do not play and exits finish at
once ([Reduced motion](motion-parts.md#reduced-motion)). Other animations read it themselves, as
`honoured` does.
