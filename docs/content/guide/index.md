:::info
Preview — Ranvier is pre-release; its APIs may change.
:::

Build reactive state for .NET: update a value, and the computations that depend on it update too.

* **Signals** hold values you can read and write.
* **Memos** derive values from tracked reads.
* **Effects** run when a value they read changes.
* **Bindings** copy one fixed signal or memo into an external target.

:::tip Async state travels through the graph
A node waiting on an async dependency is **pending**. Its readers can report loading, keep a
previous result, or use a boundary's fallback. This pending channel follows Solid 2.0 and is
independent of whether a value is out of date.
:::

## A taste

```fsharp
open Ranvier

let graph = new Graph ()

let doubled =
    graph.Run (fun () ->
        let count = createSignal 1
        let doubled = createMemo (fun _ -> count.Value * 2)
        createEffect (fun () -> printfn "doubled = %d" doubled.Value)
        count.Value <- 5
        doubled)
```

```text
doubled = 2
doubled = 10
```

## What you get

:::note Signals, memos and effects
Readers see consistent values as changes propagate. An equal result stops propagation at that node.
:::

:::note Owners and cleanup
Every memo, effect and binding belongs to a scope. Dispose the scope to release its nodes and cleanups
together in reverse acquisition order.
:::

:::tip Pending axis
`AsyncSource` and async memos report pending state alongside their values. Flight policies control
what happens when inputs change during a request.
:::

:::tip Boundaries
A Suspense boundary supplies a fallback while its body is pending. An ErrorBoundary supplies a
recovered value when its body fails. Both handle dependencies read directly or through memos.
:::

:::note Keyed and index projections
Per-row reactive values over a collection, keyed by identity or by position.
:::


:::note Lookups and selectors
Lookups derive a value for each key you read. Selectors report which key is selected, triggering
the readers of the previous and new selection.
:::

:::tip Thread-affinity guard
Dispatchers move work from other threads onto the graph thread.

## Status

:::details Implementation status and planned features

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Core graph (signal, memo, effect, owners, batching) | Implemented and tested. |
| Fixed-dependency bindings | `bindSignal` and `bindMemo` provide owned, untracked writes from one declared source; see [Bindings](bindings.md). |
| Debounce and throttle | Implemented with eager capture, timed publication and injectable clocks; see [Timing](timing.md). |
| Per-node typed comparers | Implemented for signals, memos, split effects and boundaries; see [Equality](equality.md). |
| Editable keyed collections and value readers | Implemented, with direct row edits and bounded change cursors; see [Direct edits](collection-updates.fsx#direct-edits) and [Reading changes](projections.fsx#reading-changes). |
| Async and boundaries | Implemented. A pending `.Value` read throws `NotReadyException`; `TryValue` reads without throwing. |
| Projections, lookups and selectors | Implemented, including memo-free factory rows, opt-in create-first passes and trimmed reconciliation; see [Projections](projections.fsx). |
| Fable/JavaScript | Implemented; package builds contain standalone Fable source projects. CI checks repository tests and packed consumers. See [Fable (JavaScript) target](../fable/index.md). |
| Collection combinators (`Projection.filter`, `choose`, `map`, `mapWith`, `sortBy`, `groupBy`) | Implemented and tested, including pending and error behaviour; see [Collections](collection-views.fsx). |
| Editable values (`createEditable`, `createDraft`) and the MVU bridge (`Mvu`, in the `Ranvier.Elmish` package) | Implemented and tested; see [Editable values and forms](forms.md) and [Migrating from Elmish](elmish.md). |
| Shared remote queries and mutations | Implemented in `Ranvier.Query`, with acquired leases, retained refresh data and atomic reconciliation; see [Queries and mutations](queries.md). |
| Reusable lens and prism values for deep writes | Not implemented; they wait on a need for reusable focus paths over collections. |
