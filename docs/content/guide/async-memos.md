title: Async memos
---

`createAsync` returns an `AsyncMemo<'T>`. Its first read starts an async request, called a **flight**.
The memo stays pending until the task completes. A tracked input change starts another flight on
the next read.

`Peek` returns the last settled value without starting a flight. The compute function takes
`Previous<'T>` and a `CancellationToken`, and returns `Task<'T>`. For a producer of many items, use a
[stream memo](streams.md).

`createAsync` is pure; `createAsyncWith` owns the nodes and cleanups created before its first
suspending await. Their scopes follow the same rules as [pure and owning memos](memos.md#pure-and-owning-memos).
`createAsyncWithPolicy` and `createOwningAsyncWithPolicy` are the same pair with their own
[flight policy](#flight-policy).

Examples using tasks import the .NET types and construct a graph with a manual dispatcher:

```fsharp
open System
open System.Threading
open System.Threading.Tasks
open Ranvier

let newGraph () =
    new Graph ({ GraphOptions.Default with Dispatcher = Some (ManualDispatcher () :> IGraphDispatcher) })
```

When a completion arrives from another thread, pump the graph on its owning thread. See
[Threading and dispatch](threading.md) and the `pumpUntil` helper in [Testing async state](testing.md).

The body runs synchronously up to its first `await` that suspends. Only the reactive reads made in
that part are tracked. On .NET, an `await` on a task that has already completed does not suspend,
so a read after it is still tracked. Under [Fable](../fable/index.md),
every `await` resumes on a later microtask and reads after it are untracked. Even an already
completed flight first reads as `Pending`; its result becomes ready on a later microtask.

```fsharp
let flightGraph = newGraph ()
let userId = flightGraph.Run (fun () -> createSignal 1)
let response = TaskCompletionSource<string> ()

let profile =
    flightGraph.Run (fun () ->
        createAsync (fun _ _ ->
            let id = userId.Value // tracked: read before the first await

            task {
                let! body = response.Task
                return $"user %d{id}: %s{body}"
            }))

profile.TryValue
```

```text
Pending
```

Completing the task settles the memo:

```fsharp
response.SetResult "Ada"
pumpUntil flightGraph (fun () -> not (profile.Status.HasFlag Status.Pending)) (TimeSpan.FromSeconds 5.)
profile.TryValue
```

```text
Ready "user 1: Ada"
```

:::details The pumpUntil helper

`pumpUntil` is this page's helper: it calls `graph.Pump ()` until the condition holds.

```fsharp
let pumpUntil (g: Graph) (cond: unit -> bool) (timeout: TimeSpan) =
    let sw = Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew ()

    while not (cond ()) do
        if sw.Elapsed > timeout then
            failwithf "condition not met within %O" timeout

        g.Pump () |> ignore
        Threading.Thread.Sleep 1
```

:::

[Threading and dispatch](threading.md) explains when a pump is required.

:::warning Read reactive inputs before awaiting

A read in the continuation runs
outside the memo's tracking context, so a later change to that source does not start a new flight.
Read every reactive value the flight depends on before the first `await`, and capture it in a
local. On .NET a continuation can run inline inside another computation's body, when that body
completes the awaited task. Its reads are untracked there too: they link no edge to that
computation.
:::

:::details Creating nodes in an async continuation

The same boundary applies to creation. `createAsync`'s purity check and `createAsyncWith`'s scope
cover the body up to its first `await` that suspends. A node created in a continuation, `onCleanup` included,
attaches to the owner current when the continuation runs, usually the graph's root, and lives
until that owner is disposed.
:::

:::details Failures and cancellation during a flight

A body that throws before its first `await`, and a flight whose task faults, both settle the memo as
`Failed` with the original exception. A flight whose task is cancelled by its own IO, such as an
`HttpClient` timeout, settles as `Failed` with the `OperationCanceledException`. A cancellation of
a superseded flight publishes nothing.

```fsharp
let failGraph = newGraph ()

let refused =
    failGraph.Run (fun () -> createAsync (fun _ _ -> failwith "no connection" : Task<int>))

let faulting = TaskCompletionSource<int> ()
let faulted = failGraph.Run (fun () -> createAsync (fun _ _ -> faulting.Task))
faulted.TryValue |> ignore
faulting.SetException (TimeoutException "timed out")
pumpUntil failGraph (fun () -> not (faulted.Status.HasFlag Status.Pending)) (TimeSpan.FromSeconds 5.)

let show (reading: Reading<'T>) =
    match reading with
    | Ready value -> sprintf "Ready %A" value
    | Pending -> "Pending"
    | Failed error -> sprintf "Failed %s: %s" (error.GetType().Name) error.Message

show refused.TryValue, show faulted.TryValue
```

```text
("Failed Exception: no connection", "Failed TimeoutException: timed out")
```

:::

### Flight policy

Under Fable, `Queue` applies each outcome on a later microtask even when it and the flights before
it have already settled. On .NET, settled queued outcomes can apply inline.

`GraphOptions.FlightPolicy` sets what a change does while a flight is in progress, for every async memo in the graph
that does not set its own:

| Policy | New flight at once | Old token cancelled | Superseded result discarded | Every result applied |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| `CancelPrevious` (default) | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| `KeepLatest` | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| `Queue` | Yes | No | No | Yes, in the order the flights started |
| `FinishCurrent` | No, one trailing flight after it settles | No | No flight is superseded | No |
| `Drop` | No, the change is discarded | No | No flight is superseded | No |
| `DropWhilePending` | No, the change is discarded; one replacing flight if the flight fails | No | No flight is superseded | No |

`createAsyncWithPolicy` and `createOwningAsyncWithPolicy` set the policy for one async memo. Its flights follow that
policy whatever the graph's, and async memos with different policies in one graph run independently:

```fsharp
let results = createAsyncWithPolicy CancelPrevious (fun _ token -> search query.Value token)
let history = createAsyncWithPolicy FlightPolicy.Queue (fun _ token -> save draft.Value token)
```

`CancelPrevious` and `KeepLatest` publish the same values. They differ only in whether the
superseded flight's `CancellationToken` is cancelled. Pass the token to the IO the flight performs,
so that `CancelPrevious` requests cancellation of superseded IO. The operation must cooperate with
the token; cancellation does not guarantee that work or external side effects stop.

Compare this queued replay with the default-policy map below. Three flights start; the
newest answer waits until both older answers can be applied in order.

```fsharp map replay code=collapsed policy=queue
let desk = Desk<int>(queued = true)
let page = createSignal 1
let result = createAsync (fun _ _ -> desk.Quote page.Value)
createEffect (fun () -> printfn "result = %d" result.Value)

controls [
    button "Page 2" (fun () -> page.Value <- 2)
    |> describe "Page 2 starts a second quote while the first remains pending."
    |> expect "Page 2 starts a second quote while the first remains pending." (fun () -> desk.Pending = 2)
    button "Page 3" (fun () -> page.Value <- 3)
    |> describe "Page 3 starts a third quote; all three await answers."
    |> expect "Page 3 starts a third quote; all three await answers." (fun () -> desk.Pending = 3)
    button "Answer newest: 30" (fun () -> desk.SettleNewest 30)
    |> describe "The newest answer waits for the two older flights."
    |> expect "The newest answer waits for the two older flights." (fun () -> desk.Pending = 2)
    button "Answer oldest: 10" (fun () -> desk.Settle 10)
    |> describe "The first answer applies; the newest still waits behind the second."
    |> expect "The first answer applies; the newest still waits behind the second." (fun () -> result.Peek = 10 && desk.Pending = 1)
    button "Answer next: 20" (fun () -> desk.Settle 20)
    |> describe "The second answer releases the queued third answer; the final result is 30."
    |> expect "The second answer releases the queued third answer; the final result is 30." (fun () -> result.Peek = 30 && desk.Pending = 0)
]
```

:::details Starting flights and observing exceptions

`CancelPrevious`, `KeepLatest` and `Queue` start a new flight as soon as a changed memo is read, and
decide only the fate of the flights already in progress. The memo observes every flight's exception, including a superseded
flight's and one raised after the memo or its graph was disposed, so `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException`
receives none of them.

:::

:::details When to use FinishCurrent

`FinishCurrent` lets the flight in progress finish. A change during it runs no body and starts no
flight, and the memo stays pending. When the flight settles, the memo runs once more against the
current inputs, however many changes arrived: its value becomes the `Peek` value and the trailing
run's previous value, and a failure is discarded. The trailing run starts at the memo's next read,
so a memo read by an effect starts it as soon as the flight settles. A flight with no change during
it applies as under `KeepLatest`. Use it for work that must not be abandoned halfway, such as a
save, where the settled value must still match the latest inputs.

:::

:::details When to use Drop

`Drop` discards every change that arrives while a flight is in progress. The change runs no body
and starts no flight, and nothing is replayed when the flight settles: its value or its error
becomes the memo's, and the memo is current until a source changes again. The first change after
the settle starts a flight as usual. The settled value can belong to inputs the graph has since
left. The settle brings the memo's sources current: a memo source left stale by a discarded change
recomputes then, and an async memo source starts its flight then, without waiting for a read. That
source's own settle is a change after the memo's settle and runs the memo. Use it for a submit that ignores repeated clicks while the request is in flight, as R3's
`AwaitOperation.Drop` and Rx's `exhaustMap` do.

:::

:::details When to use DropWhilePending

`DropWhilePending` discards the changes that arrive while a flight is pending, as `Drop` does, and
keeps a successful flight's value. A failed flight that discarded a change does not publish its
error: the memo stays pending and runs once more against the current inputs, so a failure always
belongs to the latest inputs. The replacing run starts at the memo's next read, and its previous
value is the value published before the failed flight. A failed flight with no change during it
settles to its error, and so does a replacing run that fails with no change during it. Use it
where a stale success is acceptable and a stale failure is not, such as a refresh that a newer
query may repair.

:::

:::details Compare policies with other .NET libraries

The following names describe related scheduling choices in
[R3](https://github.com/Cysharp/R3#interoperability-with-asyncawait) and
[SignalsDotnet](https://github.com/fedeAlterio/SignalsDotnet). They are scheduling parallels, not
interchangeable APIs or identical state semantics: stream operators and computed signals do not share
Ranvier's demand-driven flights, `Previous.Settled` or propagating pending channel.

| Ranvier | R3 `AwaitOperation` | SignalsDotnet `ConcurrentChangeStrategy` |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `CancelPrevious` | `Switch` | `CancelCurrent` |
| `KeepLatest` | none (`Switch` without the cancellation) | none |
| `Queue` | `SequentialParallel` | none |
| `FinishCurrent` | none | none |
| `Drop` | `Drop` | none |
| `DropWhilePending` | none | none |

`FinishCurrent` is closest to SignalsDotnet's `ScheduleNext` and R3's `ThrottleFirstLast`. Both
publish the finished run's result; `FinishCurrent` keeps the memo pending until the trailing run
settles, so a published value always belongs to the current inputs.

Ranvier does not implement these policies:

| Policy | R3 `AwaitOperation` | SignalsDotnet `ConcurrentChangeStrategy` |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Run one flight at a time, queue every change | `Sequential` | none |
| Run once more after the current run and publish both results | none | `ScheduleNext` |
| Run every flight, apply results in completion order | `Parallel` | none |
| Run the first and the last change | `ThrottleFirstLast` | none |

CommunityToolkit's `AsyncRelayCommand` has no async-memo counterpart. `AllowConcurrentExecutions` is a
gate on `CanExecute` for a command with no result: `false` reports the command as not executable while
it runs, and `true` lets executions overlap. An async memo has no `CanExecute`: every change starts a
new flight, under `FinishCurrent` a trailing one, and under `Drop` and `DropWhilePending` none while
a flight is in progress. For commands, C# has `ReactiveCommand`, whose
`CommandPolicy.Disable` provides analogous command gating to
[`AllowConcurrentExecutions = false`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/generators/relaycommand#handling-concurrent-executions);
this is not an async-memo drop policy. See [C#](csharp.md#commands).
Debounce and throttle are implemented as [timed values](timing.md). Read one from the async memo to
control when requests start, and choose the flight policy separately to handle requests already running.

:::

:::details Cancellation costs

- `CancelPrevious` allocates a `CancellationTokenSource` per launch, cancelling and disposing the
  previous source.
- `KeepLatest` and `Queue` share a source across overlapping flights. It is disposed without
  cancellation once all flights using it settle; the next flight allocates another.
- `FinishCurrent`, `Drop` and `DropWhilePending` allocate one source per non-overlapping flight,
  disposed without cancellation at settlement. A change during the flight allocates nothing.

Disposing the memo cancels its live source. Cancellation also runs registered callbacks, including
those installed by I/O APIs. Signals, memos and effects carry no cancellation token.

:::

:::details Token registrations and lifetime

A registration on the token lives as long as its source. `use _ = token.Register ...`, and every API
that takes the token and completes (`Task.Delay`, `HttpClient`, `SemaphoreSlim.WaitAsync`,
`cancellableTask` binds), releases its registration when the operation ends. A registration left
undisposed is released with the source: under `CancelPrevious` at the next launch, under `FinishCurrent`,
`Drop` and `DropWhilePending` when its flight settles, under `KeepLatest` and `Queue` once the flights sharing the source have all settled, so a stream of overlapping flights
keeps each one's registration until the stream goes quiet. A flight that completes only on
cancellation stays in progress under `KeepLatest` and `Queue` until the memo is disposed, together
with everything its task and registrations hold; use `CancelPrevious` for such bodies. Work that
outlives its flight and keeps the token sees a disposed source once the source is released: it is
not cancelled when the memo is disposed, and `token.WaitHandle` throws `ObjectDisposedException`.
`FlightPolicyBenchmarks` in the [suspension bench](../benchmarks/suspension.md#flightpolicybenchmarks)
compares a launch under `CancelPrevious` with one under `KeepLatest`, and `FlightBenchmarks`
compares every policy, with and without changes during a flight.

:::

Try the default policy in the map. `Desk` keeps each request pending until you answer it:

- Press **Next user** twice to supersede a flight.
- Press **Answer** to settle the newest flight, or **Fail** to fail it.
- Use the timeline to step through the events.

```fsharp map replay code=collapsed
let desk = Desk<string>()
let userId = createSignal 1
let profile = createAsync (fun _ _ -> desk.Quote userId.Value)
createEffect (fun () -> printfn $"profile {profile.Value}")

controls [
    button "Next user" (fun () -> userId.Value <- userId.Value + 1)
    button "Answer" (fun () -> desk.Settle $"user {userId.Value}")
    button "Fail" (fun () -> desk.Fail "no connection")
]
```

:::details Reading queued outcomes while later flights run

Under `Queue` each outcome is readable as soon as it is applied, while later flights are still in
progress: a new run makes the memo pending until the next outcome is applied. A body that throws
before its first `await` fails in its turn, after the flights started before it. While the newest
run waits on a pending source, an earlier flight's value becomes the `Peek` value and the memo stays
pending.

:::

### The previous value

The body's first argument is a `Previous<'T>`: a handle on the value the memo last published. Its
one member, `Settled`, is a `Task<'T voption>` that completes with `ValueNone` before the first value. As
on a [memo](memos.md#the-previous-value), a run that suspends on a pending source or fails
leaves the previous value unchanged.

:::details Previous values under each flight policy

Read every input, then await `previous.Settled`. Under every policy except `Queue`, `Settled` is
complete when the body runs. Under `CancelPrevious` and `KeepLatest`, only the newest flight's result
becomes a previous value; under `FinishCurrent`, a trailing run receives the value of the flight it
waited for, or the value before it when that flight failed. Under `Drop`, the next run receives the
settled flight's value; under `DropWhilePending`, a replacing run receives the value published
before the failed flight.
Under `Queue`, `Settled` completes when the flight started before this one is applied, so the
flights fold in start order. An await on it suspends, and reads after it are untracked. If the
earlier flight fails or is dropped, `Settled` returns the value published before it. Disposing the
memo completes a pending `Settled` with the value last published.

:::

:::details Cost of reading Settled

`Settled` creates its task when first read: one completed task, shared by every read until the memo
next publishes, or under `Queue`, one pending task for a flight that waits on an earlier one. The
async scenarios in the [counter bench](../benchmarks/counters.md) run within 0.1 % of their earlier
instruction counts, with the same allocation.

### Bodies written with cancellableTask

On .NET, the `cancellableTask` builder from [IcedTasks](https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/IcedTasks)
builds a `CancellationToken -> Task<'T>`: write the body as `fun previous -> cancellableTask { ... }`, or
apply it to the token as below. Its `let!` and `do!` pass
the flight's token to any `CancellationToken -> Task` they bind, and each bind throws once the
token is cancelled. Under `CancelPrevious`, a superseded flight stops at its next bind and settles
as cancelled, so it publishes nothing.

```fsharp
open IcedTasks

let http = new Net.Http.HttpClient (BaseAddress = Uri "https://example.com")

let fetchProfile (id: int) (token: CancellationToken) : Task<string> =
    http.GetStringAsync ($"/users/%d{id}", token)

let profile =
    createAsync (fun _ token ->
        (cancellableTask {
            let id = userId.Value // tracked: read before the first bind that suspends
            let! body = fetchProfile id
            return $"user %d{id}: %s{body}"
        }) token)
```

:::warning Create a fresh cancellableTask for each flight

Build the `cancellableTask` inside the function, once per flight. When the compiler cannot turn
the builder into a static state machine, as in Debug builds, the invocations of a single
`cancellableTask` value share their resumption state: a flight started while an earlier one is
suspended resumes at the earlier flight's `await` and blocks on it. A body bound once, as in
`let body = cancellableTask { ... }` then `createAsync (fun _ -> body)`, can pass every test in Release
and hang in Debug.

:::

The tracking and purity rules of the body are unchanged: the builder runs synchronously up to its
first bind that suspends. IcedTasks targets .NET only; a body shared with Fable stays a `task`.

:::details Disposal while pending
A disposed async memo reads as `Failed` with an `ObjectDisposedException`. Its readers are woken once to see the failure.
