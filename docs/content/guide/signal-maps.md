title: Signal maps
order: 8
description: Live, animated maps of the graph behind a docs example.
---

:::info
Preview — signal maps follow the trace log, which may change before the first release.
:::

A signal map shows the graph behind an example. Writes flash, dependency marks travel along
edges, computations light up, and async flights start, settle, fail or drop.

Maps run the real engine compiled to JavaScript with tracing enabled. Their animations follow
the [trace log](tracing.md).

Maps appear throughout these docs beneath the examples they draw. This page explains how to read one
and how to write one.

Use **Example code** to expand or collapse a map's code. The graph and its controls stay visible.
Authors can choose the initial state and cap the code area's height; taller code scrolls, including
long listings. These disclosures work with keyboard controls and with JavaScript disabled.

## Reading a map

Press **Add tea**, then **Settle quote**. A cart's subtotal feeds a shipping quote, which the buttons
answer by hand.

```fsharp map
let desk = Desk<int>()
let lines = createSignal [ "tea", 4, 1 ]

let subtotal =
    createMemo (fun _ ->
        lines.Value |> List.sumBy (fun (_, price, qty) -> price * qty))

let shipping = createAsync (fun _ _ -> desk.Quote subtotal.Value)
let total = createMemo (fun _ -> subtotal.Value + shipping.Value)
createEffect (fun () -> printfn $"total {total.Value}")

controls [
    button "Add tea" (fun () -> lines.Value <- lines.Value @ [ "tea", 4, 1 ])
    button "Settle quote" (fun () -> desk.Settle 5)
    button "Fail quote" (fun () -> desk.Fail "quote down")
]
```

Sources sit on the left and observers on the right; an edge runs from each node to every node that
read it. The value above a node is its latest value.

| Mark | Node |
| --- | --- |
| Solid circle | Signal |
| Dashed circle | Async source or async memo |
| Rounded rectangle | Memo, boundary or projection |
| Thick rounded rectangle | Debounce or throttle |
| Dashed rounded rectangle | Stream memo |
| Diamond | Effect or binding |

| Look | State |
| --- | --- |
| Faded | Created and not yet run |
| Filled | Running |
| Spinning ring | A flight is in progress |
| Dotted outline, dimmed value | Waiting on a pending source |
| Red outline and value | Failed; the value is the error |
| Dashed thick outline, clock caption | A timed admission window is open; the value above stays published output |
| Doubled outline | A stream is open |

A dot travelling an edge is a mark: the source tells its observer it may be stale. A bright dot means
the source's value moved. A ring that fades is a dropped flight.

Hover or focus a node for its path, state, value and run count. Click it for the cause chain of its
last run, as `Trace.why` renders it. The log beneath the buttons lists the latest events.

Timed nodes show captures, window changes, suppression, cancellation and publication in the log.
Their caption shows the captured input while a window is open; hover or focus for the mode and
remaining time recorded at that event. Pending capture can retain a ready or failed publication,
so it does not automatically dim the published value. Timing windows use their own mark and never
spin an async flight ring. Try the [debounce and throttle maps](timing.md#watch-admission-on-the-signal-map).

## Timelines and replays

`timeline` adds **Play**, **Step**, **Speed** and a scrub bar. Each tick represents an event; the bar starts
after setup, and the log initially shows setup's latest events.

Choose **Speed** to slow down or speed up playback. `speed=0.5` starts at half speed;
`speed=2` starts at double speed. The default is `1`, and values from `0.25` to `4` are accepted.
Speed changes both event timing and animation durations. You can change it while playing;
**Reset** keeps your selected speed. Reduced-motion playback remains immediate.

Try **Two quick writes** below. The first flight is superseded: its ring fades and the log shows
`drop shipping (superseded)`. **Settle quote** answers the newest flight.

```fsharp map timeline
let desk = Desk<int>()
let qty = createSignal 1
let subtotal = createMemo (fun _ -> 4 * qty.Value)
let shipping = createAsync (fun _ _ -> desk.Quote subtotal.Value)
createEffect (fun () -> printfn $"shipping {shipping.Value}")

controls [
    button "Two quick writes" (fun () ->
        qty.Value <- qty.Value + 1
        qty.Value <- qty.Value + 1)
    button "Settle quote" (fun () -> desk.Settle 5)
]
```

Inputs write as you change them: the slider on every movement, the toggle on each flip.

```fsharp map timeline
let qty = createSignal 1
let gift = createSignal false
let subtotal = createMemo (fun _ -> 4 * qty.Value)
let total = createMemo (fun _ -> subtotal.Value + (if gift.Value then 2 else 0))
createEffect (fun () -> printfn $"total {total.Value}")

controls [
    sliderSignal "Qty" (1, 10) qty [ 3 ]
    toggleSignal "Gift wrap" gift [ true ]
]
```

`replay` records the scenario and each control in order: each button once, and each input once
per replay value. The map opens at the end of setup. Press **Play** or drag the scrub bar to watch
the recorded actions.

```fsharp map replay
let desk = Desk<int>()
let lines = createSignal [ "tea", 4, 1 ]

let subtotal =
    createMemo (fun _ ->
        lines.Value |> List.sumBy (fun (_, price, qty) -> price * qty))

let shipping = createAsync (fun _ _ -> desk.Quote subtotal.Value)
let total = createMemo (fun _ -> subtotal.Value + shipping.Value)
createEffect (fun () -> printfn $"total {total.Value}")

controls [
    button "Add tea" (fun () -> lines.Value <- lines.Value @ [ "tea", 4, 1 ])
    button "Settle quote" (fun () -> desk.Settle 5)
]
```

### Replay queued flights

Under `policy=queue`, flights apply in start order. Setup and two writes start three quotes.
Watch the newest answer wait until the older two are answered; then all three apply in order.

```fsharp map replay policy=queue
let desk = Desk<int>(queued = true)
let qty = createSignal 1
let subtotal = createMemo (fun _ -> 4 * qty.Value)
let shipping = createAsync (fun _ _ -> desk.Quote subtotal.Value)
createEffect (fun () -> printfn $"shipping {shipping.Value}")

controls [
    sliderSignal "Qty" (1, 10) qty [ 2; 3 ]
    button "Answer the newest" (fun () -> desk.SettleNewest 12)
    button "Answer the older two" (fun () ->
        desk.Settle 4
        desk.Settle 8)
]
```

## Writing a map

A `map` fence holds plain Ranvier code and ends with `controls`. The page shows the code as written.
The compiled copy labels each top-level `let x = create…` binding with its name and runs the code
against a fresh traced graph.

Bindings returned by `debounce`, `throttleFirst`, `throttleLast`, `throttle` and their `With`
factories also receive their names. Their final graph argument can use `Graph.Current` inside a
map fence. `MapClock()` supplies a manual clock for deterministic examples: a control calling
`clock.Advance milliseconds` runs due callbacks in deadline order. It replaces wall-clock waits
for replay; playback speed does not change these example deadlines.

`Feed<'T>()` supplies a stream source for examples: `feed.Push item`, `feed.Burst items` (one
publication), `feed.Complete ()`, `feed.Fail message`. Return `feed.Source` from the start function of
`createStream` or `createStreamFold`; see [Streams](streams.md).

Top-level projection aggregates also receive their binding's name: `Projection.sumBy`, `countBy`,
`exists`, `forall`, `fold` and `foldGroup`, called directly or at the end of a pipeline. For example:

```fsharp
let total =
    rows
    |> Projection.sumBy id // named total on the map
```

Trailing comments are preserved, including on lookup and editable bindings. For nodes created inside
a callback or by a custom helper, use `Trace.named "name" (fun () -> …)` explicitly.

:::details Map fence options

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `timeline` | Adds the play, step and scrub bar. |
| `replay` | Runs every control in order, for the timeline to play back; implies `timeline`. |
| `speed=` | Initial playback multiplier from `0.25` to `4`, such as `speed=0.5`; defaults to `1`. Readers can change it with **Speed**. |
| `policy=` | The graph's flight policy: `cancel-previous` (default), `keep-latest`, `queue`, `finish-current`, `drop` or `drop-while-pending`. |
| `groups=` | How collections draw: `expand` (default), a box with a row per key, or `collapse`, one node. |
| `code=` | The code disclosure's initial state: `open` (default) or `collapsed`. The map stays visible in either state. |
| `code-max-height=` | Optional positive length in `px`, `rem`, `em` or `vh`, such as `code-max-height=24rem`. Taller code scrolls; omitted means unrestricted height. |
| `id=`, `show=` | The cell's id on the page, and whether the page shows the code, the map or both. |

:::

### Literate scripts and IntelliSense

For a page under `docs/content/guide`, load the shared script in a hidden block:

```fsharp
(*** hide ***)
#load "../../literate.fsx"

open Ranvier
open Ranvier.Docs.Maps

let graph = new Graph ()
let active = graph.Activate ()
```

`docs/literate.fsx` references the traced engine, Ranvier.View, the map controls and `SignalMap`.
Build them once before opening the script in Rider or another F# editor:

```shell
dotnet build docs/maps/Ranvier.Docs.Maps.fsproj -c Debug -p:RanvierTrace=true
```

The normal docs build also prepares these dependencies. Rebuild them after changing the engine or map
helpers, then reload your editor's script session to pick up the new assemblies.

Write the map as ordinary F# after a literate annotation. Its functions and properties now receive
completion, tooltips and compiler diagnostics:

```fsharp
(*** map replay speed=0.5 code=collapsed ***)
let count = createSignal 1
let doubled = createMemo (fun _ -> count.Value * 2)
createEffect (fun () -> doubled.Value |> ignore)

controls [
    sliderSignal "Count" (1, 10) count [ 5 ]
    |> describe "The input refreshes doubled from 2 to 10."
    |> expect "doubled settles at 10" (fun () -> doubled.Peek = 10)
]

(*** hide ***)
active.Dispose ()
graph.Dispose ()
```

The annotation accepts the same options as a `map` fence. A prose comment or another literate
annotation ends the block. Keep each map self-contained: browser compilation runs it against a fresh
graph, independently of hidden setup and other examples in the script.

The docs build type-checks the script and runs its map expectations under Fable and Node.js.
FSI can execute the graph and control code on .NET. `SignalMap` returns a `Component<unit>`: `Server.render` draws
its empty map on .NET, and its scenario runs once the map is mounted in a browser.
See [Aggregates](aggregates.fsx) for a working literate map. Code placed inside a prose comment receives
the comment's editor treatment, so use an ordinary F# block for IntelliSense.

### Controls

The helpers in scope:

- `controls [ … ]` lists the map's controls, in order. Each action runs with the graph active, so `batch` and the
  other `Api` functions work inside it. A replay runs every control in this order.
- `button label action` runs `action` when pressed, and once in a replay.
- `sliderSignal label (min, max) signal replay` binds an integer slider directly to a signal.
  `numberSignal label signal replay`, `textSignal label signal replay` and `toggleSignal label signal replay`
  bind float, string and bool signals. Each starts from the signal's current value and follows writes made
  by other controls. Sliders write on movement and toggles on a flip; numbers and text write when committed,
  with Enter or by leaving the field. A replay writes each value in `replay`, in order.
- `slider label (min, max) start replay set`, `number label start replay set`, `text label start replay set` and
  `toggle label start replay set` accept a callback for computed writes, such as editing a row in a collection.
  `start` sets these widgets only: keep it equal to the data's initial value. They retain their local widget state
  when another control changes the data. Both forms log `set <label> = <value>` before each replay input.
- `Desk<'T>()` stands in for a remote service. `desk.Quote x` returns a request that stays pending; a newer request
  cancels it. `desk.Settle value` and `desk.Fail message` answer the pending request.
- `Desk<'T>(queued = true)` keeps every request, in order. `Settle` and `Fail` answer the oldest; `SettleNewest`
  and `FailNewest` the newest. `desk.Pending` counts the requests waiting.

### Bound inputs

Change the fields, then press **Load another order**. The button changes all four signals and their
widgets follow. **Reset** rebuilds the graph and restores the initial fields.

```fsharp map timeline code=collapsed
let qty = createSignal 1
let price = createSignal 4.5
let name = createSignal "Tea"
let gift = createSignal false
let total = createMemo (fun _ -> float qty.Value * price.Value + (if gift.Value then 2.0 else 0.0))
createEffect (fun () -> printfn "%s: total %.2f" name.Value total.Value)

let quantityInput = sliderSignal "Qty" (1, 10) qty [ 3 ]
let priceInput = numberSignal "Price" price [ 6.5 ]
let nameInput = textSignal "Name" name [ "Coffee" ]
let giftInput = toggleSignal "Gift wrap" gift [ true ]

controls [
    quantityInput
    priceInput
    nameInput
    giftInput
    button "Load another order" (fun () ->
        batch (fun () ->
            qty.Value <- 2
            price.Value <- 8.0
            name.Value <- "Jam"
            gift.Value <- false))
    |> expect "the fields follow the loaded order" (fun () ->
        quantityInput.Binding.Value () = InputValue.Integer 2 &&
        priceInput.Binding.Value () = InputValue.Number 8.0 &&
        nameInput.Binding.Value () = InputValue.Text "Jam" &&
        giftInput.Binding.Value () = InputValue.Toggle false &&
        total.Peek = 16.0)
]
```

The quantity control is authored as:

```fsharp
sliderSignal "Qty" (1, 10) qty [ 3 ]
```

Bindings read with `Peek`, so the widgets add no dependency edges or effects to the map. An unchanged
signal leaves uncommitted text alone; an external write replaces it with the new signal value.

### Explain and check a replay

Use `describe` to give an action a caption. It stays visible while that action's events play,
and scrubbing backwards restores the caption for the earlier action. This lets an output-only
map explain what to watch without displaying its source.

Use `expect` to check the state after an action. `dotnet fsi build.fsx -- docs` runs maps containing
expectations under Fable and Node.js; a failed check stops the build and reports the page, fence line, control
and your message. Replays also report failures in the map itself.

```fsharp map replay speed=0.5 code=collapsed
let count = createSignal 1
let doubled = createMemo (fun _ -> count.Value * 2)
createEffect (fun () -> doubled.Value |> ignore)

controls [
    button "Write 5" (fun () -> count.Value <- 5)
    |> describe "The write refreshes doubled from 2 to 10."
    |> expect "doubled settles at 10" (fun () -> doubled.Peek = 10)
]
```

Author the action like this:

```fsharp
button "Write 5" (fun () -> count.Value <- 5)
|> describe "The write refreshes doubled from 2 to 10."
|> expect "doubled settles at 10" (fun () -> doubled.Peek = 10)
```

An input's caption and checks apply to every replay value. Chain `expect` calls to check several
properties; they run in the order written. Use `Peek`, counters or captured output so a check
does not force a lazy memo and change the behaviour you are demonstrating.

Checks run after one turn of queued continuations, not after an arbitrary remote request.
Use a `Desk` settlement or `AsyncSource.Settle` action to control async examples. Captions and
expectations apply to replay actions; live controls keep their normal interactive behaviour.

:::warning End the fence with controls
A map fence must compile to JavaScript through Fable and end with `controls`. A missing
`controls` is reported at the fence's last line.
:::

## Collections

A projection appears as a box with its node on top and one row per key below. An edge from a row
means the reader reads that key; an edge from the projection means it reads `Keys`.

Move **Tea**, then add an egg. The tea row updates for its new quantity, and a row is added for
the egg. The item computation runs inside the projection node and appears as `rows[tea] item`
in the log.

```fsharp map timeline
let lines = createSignal [ "tea", 1; "jam", 2 ]
let rows = createProjection fst (fun (_, qty) -> 4 * qty) (fun () -> lines.Value)
let total = createMemo (fun _ -> rows.Keys |> Array.sumBy rows.Get)
createEffect (fun () -> printfn $"total {total.Value}")

controls [
    slider "Tea" (1, 5) 1 [ 3 ] (fun qty ->
        lines.Value <- lines.Value |> List.map (fun (sku, q) -> sku, (if sku = "tea" then qty else q)))
    toggle "Egg" false [ true ] (fun on ->
        lines.Value <-
            if on then lines.Value @ [ "egg", 1 ]
            else lines.Value |> List.filter (fun (sku, _) -> sku <> "egg"))
]
```

### Per-row async values

A node created by a `createProjectionWith` factory belongs to its key and sits to the left of
that row. Each row below requests its own price. Settle the quotes one at a time to watch the
rows clear; the projection remains pending while any row is pending.

```fsharp map timeline
let desk = Desk<int>(queued = true)
let lines = createSignal [ "tea"; "jam" ]
let prices =
    createProjectionWith id (fun sku ->
        let quote = Trace.named "quote" (fun () -> createAsync (fun _ _ -> desk.Quote (sku ())))
        fun () -> quote.Value) (fun () -> lines.Value)
createEffect (fun () -> printfn "tea %d" (prices.Get "tea"))
createEffect (fun () -> printfn "jam %d" (prices.Get "jam"))

controls [
    button "Settle the oldest" (fun () -> desk.Settle 4)
    button "Fail the oldest" (fun () -> desk.Fail "no stock")
]
```

### Lookups and selection

A lookup is drawn the same way: a row per key read, beneath the memo of its state. Moving the selection marks only the
rows of the two keys whose answer changed; the third row stays quiet.

```fsharp map timeline
let selected = createSignal 1
let isSelected = createSelector (fun () -> selected.Value)
let first = createMemo (fun _ -> isSelected.Get 1)
let second = createMemo (fun _ -> isSelected.Get 2)
let third = createMemo (fun _ -> isSelected.Get 3)
createEffect (fun () -> printfn $"{first.Value} {second.Value} {third.Value}")

controls [
    sliderSignal "Selected" (1, 3) selected [ 2; 3 ]
]
```

:::details Give a lookup its name on the map

A `map` fence wraps `createLookup`, `createSelector`, `createEditable` and `createDraft` bindings
in `Trace.named`. Both single-line and multiline bindings receive their variable's name.

:::

### Collapse a collection

`groups=collapse` draws each collection as one node containing its rows and their nodes.
Here is the first collection map with its rows collapsed:

```fsharp map timeline groups=collapse
let lines = createSignal [ "tea", 1; "jam", 2 ]
let rows = createProjection fst (fun (_, qty) -> 4 * qty) (fun () -> lines.Value)
let total = createMemo (fun _ -> rows.Keys |> Array.sumBy rows.Get)
createEffect (fun () -> printfn $"total {total.Value}")

controls [
    slider "Tea" (1, 5) 1 [ 3 ] (fun qty ->
        lines.Value <- lines.Value |> List.map (fun (sku, q) -> sku, (if sku = "tea" then qty else q)))
]
```

## A bespoke map

:::details Build a SignalMap component directly

`SignalMap` returns an ordinary Ranvier.View `Component<unit>`. A `ranvier` fence renders any such component; here
it renders a map of a hand-written scenario, whose names come from `Trace.named` rather than from the `map` fence's
labels. `SignalMap` takes the scenario, the graph's flight policy, the code bindings, whether to show the timeline and
how to draw collections. The fence's `render=` names the component value; the page renders it on the server and the
browser hydrates it.

`SignalMapWithSpeed speed` accepts those same arguments after an initial speed multiplier.

```fsharp ranvier render=Thermo.Thermometer
module Thermo =
    open Ranvier
    open Ranvier.Docs.Maps

    let scenario (graph: Graph) =
        use _ = graph.Activate ()
        let celsius = Trace.named "celsius" (fun () -> createSignal 20.0)
        let fahrenheit = Trace.named "fahrenheit" (fun () -> createMemo (fun _ -> celsius.Value * 9.0 / 5.0 + 32.0))
        let warm = Trace.named "warm" (fun () -> createMemo (fun _ -> celsius.Value >= 25.0))
        createEffect (fun () -> printfn $"{fahrenheit.Value}°F, warm: {warm.Value}")

        controls [
            button "Warmer" (fun () -> celsius.Value <- celsius.Value + 5.0)
            button "Cooler" (fun () -> celsius.Value <- celsius.Value - 5.0)
        ]

    let Thermometer = SignalMap (Live scenario) FlightPolicy.CancelPrevious [||] false Grouping.Expand
```

:::

## Edit a map

This map runs in your browser: change the code and press **Run** to compile it again and redraw the
graph. Start with this small boundary example, then try the timed values and conditional reads
from the [home page's cart](../index.md#watch-the-graph-think). Try adding a memo or a button.

```fsharp live
open Ranvier
open Ranvier.Docs.Maps

let scenario (graph: Graph) =
    use _ = graph.Activate ()
    let price = Trace.named "price" (fun () -> createAsyncSource<int> ())
    let total = Trace.named "total" (fun () -> createMemo (fun _ -> price.Value * 3))

    let view =
        Trace.named "view" (fun () ->
            createBoundary
                (fun _ -> "Loading…")
                (fun ex _ -> "Unavailable: " + ex.Message)
                (fun () -> sprintf "Total %d" total.Value))

    createEffect (fun () -> printfn "%s" view.Value)

    let offline = exn "feed offline"

    controls [
        button "Settle 4" (fun () -> price.Settle 4)
        button "Fail" (fun () -> price.Fail offline)
        button "Settle 5" (fun () -> price.Settle 5)
    ]

let map = SignalMap (Live scenario) FlightPolicy.CancelPrevious [||] true Grouping.Expand

// The mount and its graph live as long as the editor's output.
let mounted = MapMount.body map
```

An editable map spells out what a `map` fence adds when the site is built: `Trace.named` names each node, and
the last lines build the map component and mount it on a graph of its own. `MapMount.body` calls
`Mounting.mount`; the handle it returns disposes the mount and its graph, and the snippet keeps it for as long as the
editor's output lives. The site's own maps are rendered on the server and hydrated instead. The compiler loads the first time you press **Run**,
which takes a few seconds.

## Limits

Keep maps small: beyond about ten nodes, edges cross and text shrinks.

:::details Layout, values and tracing limits

- **Small graphs.** Nodes are layered by longest path, with no crossing minimisation. Beyond about ten
  nodes, edges cross and text shrinks.
- **Initial values are not drawn.** The log records a node's value when it moves, not when it is
  created. A signal shows its value from its first write.
- **Boundaries and projections share the memo mark.** A boundary's fallback or recovered state shows
  as its value. Projection internals such as row watches are hidden.
- **JavaScript equality.** Maps run under Fable, where `decimal`, `DateTime` and structs compare by
  reference. A memo returning one moves on every run, so its readers always run again. See
  [Fable](../fable/index.md).
- **The dependency graph, not the owner tree.** A disposed node leaves the map.
- **Values are text.** A value longer than 16 characters is cut short; the hover label has it whole.
  An error shows its message without its exception type.
- **Last run only.** A click explains the most recent run; `Trace.history` and `Trace.whyNot` are
  not in the map.

:::

## Next

- [Tracing](tracing.md): the log a map draws, and the queries that answer why a node ran.
- [Async and pending](async-and-pending.md): flights, boundaries and the pending channel, each with
  its map.
