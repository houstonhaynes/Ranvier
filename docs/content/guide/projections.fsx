A projection gives each collection row its own reactive value. Key by identity to keep rows
when items move, or by position to keep slots when their contents change.

The examples run inside an [active graph](graph.fsx).

## Choosing a form

- Use a **keyed projection** when items have stable identities, such as IDs.
- Use an **index projection** when rows should stay at their positions as items change.
- Use a **factory form** when each row needs its own nodes or cleanup.
- Use `createProjectionOnce` for a factory result that stays fixed for the lifetime of its key,
  such as a view object that manages its own bindings.
- Use a **lookup** for a value per requested key, or a **selector** for selection membership.

:::details Creator signatures and row lifetimes

| Creator | Keyed by | Row value | Per-key nodes |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| `createProjection keyOf map source` | `keyOf item` | `map item`, re-run when the key's item or a value `map` read changes | none |
| `createProjectionWith keyOf factory source` | `keyOf item` | the reader returned by `factory`; `factory` runs once per key, untracked | created in `factory`, disposed when the key is removed |
| `createIndexProjection map source` | position | as `createProjection`; the row at a slot survives its item changing | none |
| `createIndexProjectionWith factory source` | position | as `createProjectionWith`; the factory runs once per slot | created in `factory`, disposed when the slot is removed |
| `createLookup f affected source` | any key read through `Get` | `f state key`, recomputed for the keys `affected` names | none |
| `createSelector source` | any key read through `Get` | `true` for the selected key, `false` otherwise | none |

:::

The index forms are Solid's `indexArray`. A projection is a key set plus one row per key, and each
of those is observed separately. A lookup has no key set: it holds a cell for each key that has been read.

## Reading a projection

The source returns a sequence, usually from a signal. `Keys` reads its ordered key set;
`Get key` reads one row. This projection exposes each todo's title under its ID.

type Todo = { Id: int; Title: string }

let todos =
    createSignal

            { Id = 1; Title = "Write the guide" }
            { Id = 2; Title = "Review it" }

- `Keys` is the key set in source order. A reader of `Keys` wakes only when membership or order changes.
- `Count` is the number of keys, read through `Keys`.
- `Get key` is a tracked read of that row alone. It raises `KeyNotFoundException` for an absent key
  (`The projection has no key 99.`).
- `TryGet key` returns `None` for an absent key.
- `Snapshot` is an untracked read of every row.

A source write recomputes rows whose items changed. Their readers run only when the row values
change. Unchanged items keep their previous row results.

:::details Equal records and row recomputation
The default policy compares records by reference. A fresh record with equal contents recomputes
its row, but the row's readers run only if its result changes.
:::

**Test your understanding:** does changing todo 2's title change `Keys`? Which row value changes?

    todos.Value

titles.Get 2

:::details Answer

```text
"Review it twice"
```

The key set stays the same. Only row 2's value changes.
:::

:::details Tests covering this behaviour

Pinned by `editing one row wakes that row and no other`, `reordering the collection wakes Keys and no row`
([Projections.fs](https://github.com/ranvier-org/Ranvier/blob/master/tests/Ranvier.Tests/Projections.fs))
and `an unchanged survivor is skipped`
([MapSemantics.fs](https://github.com/ranvier-org/Ranvier/blob/master/tests/Ranvier.Tests/MapSemantics.fs)).
:::

Rename one item, then reverse the collection. The row reader responds to its title change;
the key reader responds to the new order.

```fsharp map replay code=collapsed
let items = createSignal [ 1, "Write"; 2, "Review"; 3, "Publish" ]
let titles = createProjection fst snd (fun () -> items.Value)
createEffect (fun () -> printfn "row 2 = %s" (titles.Get 2))
createEffect (fun () -> printfn "keys = %A" titles.Keys)

controls [
    button "Rename row 2" (fun () -> items.Value <- items.Value |> List.map (fun (key, title) -> key, (if key = 2 then "Review twice" else title)))
    |> describe "The row value changes while the key order stays the same."
    |> expect "The row value changes while the key order stays the same." (fun () -> titles.Keys = [| 1; 2; 3 |])

    |> describe "The existing keys move into reverse order."
    |> expect "The existing keys move into reverse order." (fun () -> titles.Keys = [| 3; 2; 1 |])
]
```

## Identity

`keyOf` determines whether an edited item keeps its row:

- Key by an ID to keep the existing row when that item changes.
- Key by the whole item (`id`) to create a new row for an edited item. This follows Solid's
  unkeyed semantics.

`keyOf` must return equal keys for equal items, where items compare under the graph's equality
policy: by default, records and classes compare by reference. A pass may skip `keyOf` for an item
equal to the one at the same position in the previous pass, counted from the start or from the end.

The source is enumerated completely before the first `keyOf` call. Keeping unchanged item references
lets a pass skip key work in unchanged regions. Under the default identity policy, rebuilding every record removes that opportunity:
the pass visits all items. This does not make immutable collection updates proportional only to
the number of edited rows; the input still has to be read.

A `keyOf` that reads a tracked source, creates a node or registers cleanup disables that skipping
for every later pass. Keep identity selection a pure function of the item when possible.

:::warning Replace an item to change its key
An item whose key field is mutated in place and republished may keep its old key and row. Publish a
new item instead.
:::

The order in which a pass disposes the rows of removed keys is unspecified, and a duplicate-key
failure reports one of the duplicated keys.

:::warning Keys must be unique
Records and unions used as keys compare by contents. Two equal items therefore produce the same
key and fail the projection pass.
:::

:::details Key equality is separate from value equality

Keys compare structurally (`HashIdentity.Structural`) regardless of `GraphOptions.Equality`. The
equality policy applies to items and row values only. A key built fresh on every pass, such as a
tuple or an array, matches the previous pass's key when the contents are equal.

:::

A pass that produces the same key twice fails. Every read of the projection raises the failure:


*)
let duplicated =
    createProjection _.Id _.Title (fun () -> [ { Id = 1; Title = "a" }; { Id = 1; Title = "b" } ])
(**

The read raises `InvalidOperationException` with the message
`The projection produced the key 1 twice in one pass. Keys must be unique; check the keyOf function.`
`Projection.Error` holds the same exception for a pass that the scheduler ran with no reader to raise to.
`Projection.ensureUniqueKeys keyOf items` raises the same exception for the first repeated key, so a
collection can be checked before it is published.

## The factory form

`createProjectionWith` separates row setup from row computation:

1. The **factory** runs once per key, untracked. It receives an accessor for the latest item.
2. The factory returns a **reader**, which computes the row's value from tracked reads.
3. The reader refreshes when stale and read, following changes to the item or its dependencies.

The factory runs inside a scope that lives until the key is removed. Nodes created in the factory
body belong to that scope, and cleanups registered there run when the key is removed.


*)
let removed = ResizeArray<int>()

let rows =
    createProjectionWith
        _.Id
        (fun item ->
            let id = (item ()).Id
            let shout = createMemo (fun _ -> (item ()).Title.ToUpper())
            onCleanup (fun () -> removed.Add id)
            fun () -> shout.Value)
        (fun () -> todos.Value)

rows.Get 1
(**

```text
"WRITE THE GUIDE"
```


*)
todos.Value <- todos.Value |> List.filter (fun t -> t.Id <> 3)
rows.Keys, List.ofSeq removed
(**

```text
([|1; 2|], [3])
```

:::details When removal cleanups run

An unobserved projection runs its pass at the next read, so the removal and its cleanup follow the read of `rows.Keys`.

A cleanup registered in the factory may write the projection's own source; the removal completes and
the graph settles (`a removed item's cleanup may write the source without hanging`).

:::

:::warning Read pending values in the reader

A factory that reads a pending source fails its row with an `InvalidOperationException` whose message
begins `The projection's factory for key ... read a pending source`. The factory runs once and cannot
wait for the source to settle. Read the source inside the returned reader instead.

:::

:::warning Create owned nodes in the factory body

A reader, or a `map`, that
creates an owned node (a memo, effect, async value, boundary, root, projection, lookup, selector or
`onCleanup`) raises `InvalidOperationException`, and that exception becomes the row's error. The value
form's message begins `A projection's map created an owned node`; the factory form's begins
`A projection row's reader created an owned node`.
:::


*)
let misplaced =
    createProjection _.Id (fun t -> (createMemo (fun _ -> t.Title)).Value) (fun () -> todos.Value)
(**

`misplaced.Get 1` raises the error above. Moving the memo into `createProjectionWith`'s factory, as
`rows` does, creates it once per key.

:::warning The check covers direct constructors too

A reader or `map` that builds a node with
`Memo (graph, ...)`, `new Effect (...)`, `Graph.CreateRoot` or `Graph.OnCleanup` fails with the same
exception.
:::

:::details Nodes owned by a memo read from a row

A node created inside a memo that a projection row pulls belongs to that memo. A `createMemoWith`
memo keeps it until the memo's next run or disposal, whichever key or projection first read it. A
`createMemo` body that creates a node fails with `InvalidOperationException` naming
`createMemoWith`.

:::

## Create additions before retiring removals

`createProjectionWithOptions ProjectionOptions.CreateFirst keyOf factory source` changes the
order of a keyed factory pass. It creates added rows first, retires removed rows second, then
writes surviving items and publishes the keys. Without this option, a pass retires removals
before creating additions.

If a create-first factory throws, the pass disposes its new rows in reverse creation order and
keeps the previously applied rows, items and keys. Reads raise the held failure until a source
change retries the pass. Without `CreateFirst`, reads of a failed projection retry the pass.
This rollback covers the projection's rows; arrange cleanup for external resources in the factory.

## Store a factory result once per key

`createProjectionOnce options keyOf factory source` stores the factory's result directly as the
row value, without a row memo. The factory receives the same latest-item accessor as
`createProjectionWith` and runs once, untracked, in the key's scope. Use `ProjectionOptions.None`
for the default order or `ProjectionOptions.CreateFirst` for the order and rollback above.

The returned object stays the row value while the key survives. To reflect item changes in a view
object, create memos and [bindings](bindings.md) in its factory using the latest-item accessor.
A tracked `Get` observes the key set, so it wakes when that key leaves; it does not track changes
inside the stored object.

Without `CreateFirst`, a factory failure is stored on the row and its reads raise that failure.
With `CreateFirst`, a factory failure fails and rolls back the pass.

:::warning Choose the ordinary factory form for collection views
`NewValueReader`, `AsObservableCollection` and the `Projection` view and aggregate operators raise
`NotSupportedException` for rows made with `createProjectionOnce`. Use `createProjectionWith`
when consumers need those APIs. `Keys` and key readers remain available for membership and order.

## Index projections

An index projection keys rows by position. The row at a slot survives its item changing, and
shortening the source drops the trailing slots.

let letters = createSignal [ "a"; "b"; "c" ]

let slots =
    createIndexProjection (fun (s: string) -> s.ToUpper ()) (fun () -> letters.Value)
(**


*)
letters.Value <- [ "z" ]
slots.Keys, slots.Get 0
(**

```text
([|0|], "Z")
```

## Pending and failed rows

`Keys` resolves independently of row values, so membership can be available while rows are pending.
A pending row raises `NotReadyException` from `Get` and `TryGet`; a failed row re-raises its reader's
exception. Use a boundary around each row or the whole collection to handle unavailable values.

:::details Pending summaries, snapshots and read costs

- `AnyPending` wakes its reader only when the answer changes. A read is O(1) while no row is pending, and
  costs a pass over the pending rows otherwise.
- `PendingKeys` lists the pending rows in key order, and costs a pass over the keys on every read while
  any row is pending.
- Both count only rows that have been read: an unread row is absent from the summary.
- A read of either brings the pending rows current first, so a reader of the summary and of a row sees
  them agree, and runs once when a row settles. A row the reader's own run makes pending shows only in
  the run's later reads of the summary.
- `Snapshot` and `AsObservableCollection` show a pending or failed row's last settled value, and leave
  out a row that has never settled.

:::

The pending channel itself is described in [Async and pending](async-and-pending.md).

## Laziness

A projection with no observed row, key set or pending summary is lazy: writes to its source run no pass,
and the next read runs one pass. Once an effect or memo observes it, a write to the source schedules
the pass eagerly.

A flush runs every scheduled pass before the effects the write woke, so an effect that reads a memo over
the keys or a row, and the source, sees both from the same write. A pass that publishes new keys schedules
the passes of the projections that read them, and those run before the effects as well. Inside a `batch`,
or in a body after the write, a memo over the keys or a row holds the previous pass's value until the
flush or a direct read of `Keys` or `Get`. That read runs the pass, and the memo is current from then on.

## Binding to a UI list

`AsObservableCollection ()` returns an `ObservableCollection` holding the row values in key order, kept
current by an effect owned by the calling scope.


*)
let view = titles.AsObservableCollection ()
(**


*)
todos.Value <- todos.Value @ [ { Id = 4; Title = "Celebrate" } ]
List.ofSeq view
(**

```text
["Write the guide"; "Review it twice"; "Celebrate"]
```

:::details UI notifications, cost and lifetime

The collection reconciles membership and order with individual item events, so a bound
list control keeps its unchanged items:

- The first population raises one `Reset`, followed by one `Add` per value.
- A departed row raises `Remove`, and a new row raises `Add` at its position in key order.
- A reorder raises `Move` only for the rows outside the longest run that kept its order. Swapping two
  neighbours raises one `Move`.
- A row whose value changed, under the graph's equality policy, raises one `Replace`.

After initial population, value-only updates consume settled-value reader deltas and replace only
changed accepted values; they do not poll every row. Membership/order reconciliation scans the visible
keys and uses an O(N log N) positional diff. Initial population, reset recovery and recovery after a
notification failure rebuild with `Reset` followed by `Add` events. A row settling for the first time
can also require membership reconciliation. Pending or failed rows keep their last accepted value;
rows that have never settled are omitted.

The updates stop when the calling scope is disposed or re-runs, or when the projection is disposed.

:::

## Reading changes

`NewKeyReader ()` returns a reader of the projection's membership and order, owned by the calling scope.
Each `Read ()` reports the keys added, removed or replaced since the reader's previous read, in time
proportional to the changes.

`NewValueReader ()` returns the same kind of reader, adding `KeyChange.Changed` for unequal
settled row values. It works on source projections and on collection views, including the
`Rows` of an [editable keyed collection](collection-updates.fsx#direct-edits).


*)
let reader = titles.NewKeyReader ()
reader.Read () |> ignore // the first read reports a reset

todos.Value <-
    (todos.Value |> List.filter (fun t -> t.Id <> 1))
    @ [ { Id = 5; Title = "Rest" } ]

let delta = reader.Read ()

[ for change in delta.Changes -> change.Key, change.Value ]
|> List.sortBy fst
(**

```text
[(1, Removed); (5, Added)]
```

:::details Key deltas, resets and read costs

- `Changes` holds one `KeyChange` per key: `Added`, `Removed`, or `Replaced` for a key removed and
  re-added between two reads. A key added and then removed between two reads cancels out. The order is
  unspecified; `Keys` gives the order.
- `Keys` and `PreviousKeys` are the key arrays at this read and at the previous one. `OrderChanged` is
  false when both are the same array.
- `Positional` lists the `RemoveAt`, `InsertAt` and `Move` edits that turn `PreviousKeys` into `Keys`,
  computed on first use in O(N log N).
- `IsReset` is true on the first read, after the projection is disposed, and once more than
  `max(64, N)` changes are unread. `Changes` is then empty: rebuild from `Keys`.
- `Read` is a tracked read of `Keys`, so an effect that reads the reader wakes on every change it
  reports. While the pass is pending or failed, `Read` raises what `Keys` raises and keeps the changes
  for the next read.

A key reader reports membership and order; read row values with `Get` for the keys in `Changes`. Each
reader costs one map update per added or removed key, and a projection without readers pays one null
check.

:::

### Settled row changes

After the first reset, renaming todo 2 reports its key even though membership and order stay the same.

*)
let valueReader = titles.NewValueReader ()
valueReader.Read () |> ignore

todos.Value <-
    todos.Value
    |> List.map (fun t -> if t.Id = 2 then { t with Title = "Final review" } else t)

let valueDelta = valueReader.Read ()
[ for change in valueDelta.Changes -> change.Key, change.Value ]
(**

```text
[(2, Changed)]
```

`Changes` contains keys rather than value snapshots. Read the current row through `Get` or
`TryGet` and handle its pending/error state there. Multiple writes between reads coalesce:
these deltas are refresh hints, not a history of every intermediate value. Membership changes
take precedence over `Changed` for the same key, so an added or replaced row needs one refresh.

:::details Observation, equality and lifetime

- Settled values compare under `GraphOptions.Equality`. Status changes alone do not report
  `Changed`. Pending or failed rows retain their last accepted settled value; their next unequal
  settled value, or their first settled value, reports a change.
- Value readers share row observation and accepted values, while each keeps its own bounded
  cursor. The first value read evaluates all visible rows. Later value-only pulls
  evaluate suspect rows; membership processing can still scan keys.
- `Read` tracks membership and the value observation, so it can drive an effect on row changes.
  If the projection's pass is pending or failed, `Read` raises and preserves its unread changes.
- First reads, overflow and projection disposal report `IsReset` with empty `Changes`;
  rebuild from `delta.Keys`. `Positional` handles membership and order, not row-value refreshes.
- Readers belong to the scope that created them. Dispose a reader to stop it early; disposing
  the last value reader releases shared observation. Reading a disposed reader raises
  `ObjectDisposedException`.

:::

### Changed key windows

`KeysVersion` identifies the current key array: every new key array has a new version, and a pass
that publishes an equal key sequence keeps the version. `ChangedSince version` returns the positions
of `Keys` that can differ from the keys at `version`, as `ValueSome struct (start, previousEnd, end)`.
The keys before `start` are unchanged, and the keys after `end` equal the keys after `previousEnd` at
`version`, in order. A renderer that stores the version can patch that window of its list.

*)
let steps = createSignal [ "plan"; "write"; "test"; "ship" ]
let stepKeys = createProjection id id (fun () -> steps.Value)
let seen = stepKeys.KeysVersion

steps.Value <- [ "plan"; "write"; "review"; "edit"; "ship" ]
stepKeys.ChangedSince seen
(**

```text
ValueSome struct (2, 2, 3)
```

Positions 2 to 2 of the previous keys became positions 2 to 3. At the current version the window is
empty, with `start` equal to the key count. After a keyed pass that changed one window of positions,
the window is available against the version before that pass. Any other version gives `ValueNone`:
rebuild from `Keys`. Both members are tracked reads of `Keys`, and O(1) after it.

## Performance

[Benchmarks → Projections](../benchmarks/projections.md#ci-instruction-counts).
