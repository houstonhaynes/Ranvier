:::info
Preview — Ranvier is pre-release; its APIs may change. Tracing is a research
feature: its queries and dump schema may change before the first release.
:::

Use `Trace` to find why a node ran, why it stayed unchanged, or where it was created. A traced
build records graph operations and their source lines in a per-graph event log.

Untraced builds compile the log out; their Ranvier IL matches a build without tracing, method for
method.

## Why trace a graph

An effect's call stack shows the flush loop. The trace log connects that run to the write that
triggered it, and also explains why a node did not run. Choose a query for your question:

- **Why did this run?** A banner re-rendered after a cart edit. `Trace.why` walks from the run back
  to the write that started it, one hop per node.
- **Why did this not run?** A total stayed stale after a write. `Trace.whyNot` names the reason: an
  open batch, a node nobody reads, a check that found the upstream unchanged, or disposal.
- **Where did this node come from?** A graph holds a thousand memos. `Trace.origin` gives the file
  and line that created one, the owner chain it lives under, and its label.
- **What does the graph look like now?** `Trace.snapshot` prints the owner tree with every node's
  status, run count and sources.

## Turning it on

The `RanvierTrace` MSBuild property compiles tracing in. Debug builds default to traced; every other
configuration defaults to untraced. Set the property explicitly to override either default:

```bash
dotnet build src/Ranvier -c Release -p:RanvierTrace=true
```

A traced build defines `RANVIER_TRACE` for every project in the repository, so tests and samples see
the same build as the library.

A traced build also stops runaway reruns. A flush raises `InvalidOperationException` naming the node
once a node's own runs have queued it again 1,000 times, as an effect or projection that writes a signal
it depends on, on every run, does. A node dequeued 100,000 times in a flush, as in a cycle of nodes
writing each other's dependencies, raises too. An untraced build has no limit.

### From NuGet

The traced build ships as `Ranvier.Traced`, and the C# façade's as `Ranvier.CSharp.Traced`. Each holds
the same assembly, namespaces and version as its untraced package; only the package id differs. Reference
one or the other behind a switch of your own, and define `RANVIER_TRACE` with it:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(RanvierTrace)' == 'true'">
    <DefineConstants>$(DefineConstants);RANVIER_TRACE</DefineConstants>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Ranvier" Condition="'$(RanvierTrace)' != 'true'" />
    <PackageReference Include="Ranvier.Traced" Condition="'$(RanvierTrace)' == 'true'" />
</ItemGroup>
```

`dotnet build -p:RanvierTrace=true` then restores and builds against the traced package. Pass the same
switch to a separate `dotnet restore`. Referencing both packages at once fails the build: they carry the
same assembly.

:::details Packing a traced build

Packing the repository's traced build needs the explicit switch, `dotnet pack -c Release
-p:RanvierTrace=true`, which sets the `.Traced` id. A Debug build is traced by default and keeps the
untraced id, so `dotnet pack -c Debug` fails with an error naming the switch.

:::

The query functions exist only in a traced build. Code that calls them compiles in a traced build
alone; guard it with `#if RANVIER_TRACE`, or keep it in scripts that load a traced `Ranvier.dll`.
:::details Queries in F# Interactive

F# Interactive does not define `RANVIER_TRACE`. A script referencing a traced DLL calls the queries
directly.

:::

## Labels

Every node gets an identity path, built from the owner tree. A segment is the node's label if it
has one, otherwise its creation site. An unlabelled graph reads as file and line:

```text
/Cart.fsx:11 Memo ok runs 3 <- /Cart.fsx:9
```

`Trace.named` labels the first node or owner its function creates:

```fsharp
let lines = Trace.named "lines" (fun () -> createSignal [ { Sku = "tea"; Price = 4m; Qty = 1 } ])
let discount = Trace.named "discount" (fun () -> createSignal 0m)
let subtotal =
    Trace.named "subtotal" (fun () ->
        createMemo (fun _ -> lines.Value |> List.sumBy (fun l -> l.Price * decimal l.Qty)))
let total = Trace.named "total" (fun () -> createMemo (fun _ -> subtotal.Value - discount.Value))
let banner = Trace.named "banner" (fun () -> new Effect (graph, fun () -> printfn "total %M" total.Value))
```

`Trace.named` is available in every build. Untraced, it inlines to `f ()`, so a literal label costs
nothing.

A computed label, such as one per row, goes through `Trace.label`:

```fsharp
let prices =
    [ for i in 1 .. 3 ->
        let price = createSignal (i * 10)
        Trace.label (graph, price, $"price[{i}]")
        price ]
```

:::details Conditional labels and F# Interactive

`Trace.label` is a `Conditional("RANVIER_TRACE")` member. A caller built without `RANVIER_TRACE`
drops the call, and the interpolated string is never built. The label takes effect only in callers
compiled with the define; a script run in F# Interactive against a traced DLL keeps the site path.

:::

## Why did it run

After `lines.Value <- [ { Sku = "tea"; Price = 4m; Qty = 2 } ]`, the banner prints `total 8`.
`Trace.why` explains the banner's last run:

```fsharp
Trace.why graph banner |> Trace.render graph |> printfn "%s"
```

```text
why /banner run 2
  #49 RunStart /banner (Cart.fsx:13)
  #46 Mark /banner <- /total (Cart.fsx:13)
  #45 Moved /total (Cart.fsx:12) = 8M
  #44 RunStart /total <- /banner (Cart.fsx:12)
  #41 Mark /total <- /subtotal (Cart.fsx:12)
  #40 Moved /subtotal (Cart.fsx:11) = 8M
  #39 RunStart /subtotal <- /total (Cart.fsx:11)
  #32 Mark /subtotal <- /lines (Cart.fsx:11)
  #31 Write /lines (Cart.fsx:9) = [{ Sku = "tea"; Price = 4M; Qty = 2 }]
  root: user write #31
```

Read it from the bottom: a write to `lines` marked `subtotal`; the banner's check pulled `total`,
which pulled `subtotal`; each value moved, so the banner ran. `#n` is the event's position in the
log, and `= value` is the value a write, move or settle recorded. The chain ends at a root: a user
write, the node's creation, a pull by a reader, an async source's settle, or a cause older than the
log (`unrecorded after #n`).

:::details Earlier runs and shorter cause chains

`Trace.whyAt graph node run` explains an earlier run by number, and `Trace.whyDepth graph depth
node` stops after `depth` steps.

:::

## Why did it not run

Writing a new line list with the same subtotal leaves the banner alone:

```fsharp
lines.Value <- [ { Sku = "tea"; Price = 2m; Qty = 4 } ]
Trace.whyNot graph banner |> Trace.render graph |> printfn "%s"
```

```text
checked clean #63 over /total
```

`subtotal` recomputed to the same value, so `total` did not move, and the check walk resolved the
banner clean.

:::details Other reasons reported by whyNot

| Reason | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `queued #n` | The node is scheduled and its run has not started: a batch is open, or the flush is not reached. |
| `unobserved since mark #n` | The node was marked, and nothing reads it since. A memo whose last reader was disposed shows this. |
| `checked clean #n over ...` | A check walk found every source unchanged. |
| `skipped as the running reader #n` | The node wrote a source it reads while running. |
| `not reached: propagation stopped at #n` | Propagation stopped upstream: a write that kept its value, or a run that did not move. |
| `disposed #n` | The node was disposed. |
| `no reason recorded` | The node ran after its last mark, or was never marked. |

:::

## What did each run do

The examples in this section add an async shipping quote to the cart. A new subtotal starts a new
quote, and `total` reads both:

```fsharp
let shipping = Trace.named "shipping" (fun () -> createAsync (fun _ _ -> quote subtotal.Value))
let total = Trace.named "total" (fun () -> createMemo (fun _ -> subtotal.Value + shipping.Value))
```

`Trace.history` lists every run of a node, oldest first:

```fsharp
Trace.history graph total |> Trace.render graph |> printfn "%s"
```

```text
history /total
  run 1 #15 pending moved flush 1 root: created #8
  run 2 #55 pending flush 2 root: user write #38
  run 3 #71 ok moved flush 3 = 11M root: user write #38
```

Each line gives the run number, its `RunStart`, how it ended, whether it moved the value, the flush
it started in, the value an ended run left, and the root of its `why` chain. Run 2 read a quote
still in flight and ended pending. Run 3 ran when the quote settled; its root is the write that
started the quote.

## What is it waiting on

`Trace.waitingOn` names the pending sources the node's last run read, and lists the node's flights,
newest first:

```fsharp
Trace.waitingOn graph total |> Trace.render graph |> printfn "%s"
```

```text
waiting /total
  suspended on /shipping
```

For an async memo, it lists each flight with the run that started it and its result:

```text
waiting /shipping
  flight 2 #57 run 2 settled #64
  flight 1 #26 run 1 dropped #63 superseded
```

:::details Flight outcomes and deferred runs

The first quote settled after the second one started, so its result was dropped. A flight can end
`in flight`, `settled`, `failed`, `cancelled` or `dropped`. A dropped flight is `superseded` by a
newer flight, `disposed` with its node, `suspended`: a failure that arrived while the newest run
waits on a pending source, `trailing`: a failure that arrived while a `FinishCurrent` trailing run is
owed, or `retried`: a failure that arrived after a `DropWhilePending` flight discarded a change. A settle
marked `held pending` kept its value while a newer run waits. Its `Settle` event's `Flag`
tells the two apart: 1 for a run suspended on a pending source, 2 for an owed trailing run. A change that
arrives during a `FinishCurrent` flight records `RunDeferred` in place of a `RunStart`. A change that a
`Drop` or `DropWhilePending` flight discards records `RunDropped`, with `Flag` 0 when a read discarded it
and 1 when the flight's settle did.

:::

`Trace.why` follows a settle back to the run that started the flight:

```text
  #65 Moved /shipping (Cart.fsx:10) = 3M
  #64 Settle /shipping (Cart.fsx:10) = 3M
  #57 FlightStart /shipping (Cart.fsx:10)
  #56 RunStart /shipping <- /banner (Cart.fsx:10)
```

An `AsyncSource` settle ends the chain at `settle #n`.

## Where did it come from

```fsharp
Trace.origin graph total |> Trace.render graph |> printfn "%s"
```

```text
/total Memo at Cart.fsx:12 #8
```

The `TraceOrigin` record also carries the owner chain up to the graph root and the run that created
the node, which tells apart a node created at startup from one re-created by each run of its owner.

:::details Creation sites and resolving paths

The site is the innermost stack frame outside Ranvier, FSharp.Core and `System.*`. `Trace.resolve
graph "/total"` goes the other way, from a path to the node id.

:::

## What the graph looks like

```fsharp
Trace.snapshot graph |> Trace.render graph |> printfn "%s"
```

```text
/
  /lines Signal fresh runs 0
  /discount Signal fresh runs 0
  /subtotal Memo ok runs 3 <- /lines
  /total Memo ok runs 2 <- /subtotal, /discount
  /banner Effect ok runs 2 <- /total
```

A `map replay` fence draws a log like this one. The page runs the example and presses each button once; Play, Step and the scrubber move through its events.

```fsharp map replay code=collapsed
let lines = createSignal [ 4; 6 ]
let discount = createSignal 0
let subtotal = createMemo (fun _ -> List.sum lines.Value)
let total = createMemo (fun _ -> subtotal.Value - discount.Value)
createEffect (fun () -> printfn $"total {total.Value}")

controls [
    button "Add a line" (fun () -> lines.Value <- lines.Value @ [ 5 ])
    button "Discount 2" (fun () -> discount.Value <- 2)
]
```

:::details Inspect the graph at an earlier event

`Trace.snapshotAt graph seq` folds the log up to an earlier event, to see the graph as it was.

:::

## Dumps

`Trace.dumpText graph` returns the log as JSON Lines: a header, the folded starting state,
then one object per event. `Trace.dump graph path` writes the same text to a file.

Graphs without timed nodes retain schema 1. Debounce and throttle select schema 2; the .NET parser
accepts both. `TimedState` events retain captured and published status, the window, remaining time,
and the winning capture. Their timestamp is relative to the first timed node using that clock.
The graph assigns each clock a stable `timebase` number, so independent clock origins remain
independent. OS timer handles and absolute clock origins are omitted.

Use `Trace.timing graph node` for a live timed gate, alongside `Trace.whyNot`. It returns `None`
for nodes outside this graph or other node kinds. `TraceModel.timing events nodeId` returns the
latest recorded timing state for replay, including parsed dumps. Timed captures count as runs;
expiry publication points downstream causes at the winning capture without creating a flight.
Deterministic dumps require the same inputs and callback order; native dispatch order can vary.

:::details JSON Lines dump format

```text
{"schema":1,"target":"net","graph":1,"checkpoint":null,"seqFrom":1}
{"snapshot":{"seq":0,"root":0,"nodes":[],"owners":[],"sources":[],"observers":[],"siblings":[],"incarnations":[]}}
{"seq":1,"kind":"GraphNew","node":0,"other":1,"arg":0,"flag":0,"cause":0,"payload":null}
{"seq":2,"kind":"OwnerNew","node":2,"other":1,"arg":0,"flag":1,"cause":0,"payload":"trace-sample.fsx:29"}
{"seq":3,"kind":"NodeNew","node":1,"other":0,"arg":1,"flag":0,"cause":0,"payload":"trace-sample.fsx:31"}
{"seq":4,"kind":"Label","node":1,"other":0,"arg":0,"flag":0,"cause":0,"payload":"count"}
```

:::

The verification sample produces byte-identical dumps across repeated runs with identical inputs and
event order. Single-threaded access alone does not make async completion order, source sites or payload
formatting deterministic for every program.
`Trace.events graph` returns the raw `TraceEvent[]` for your own analysis.

## Limits

:::warning Use tracing during development
A traced build is slower, allocates per event, and retains its log for the graph's lifetime.
Ship against the untraced `Ranvier` package.
:::

:::details Platform, lifetime and query limits

- **Fable records and text dumps.** A Fable build records the log that [signal maps](signal-maps.md)
  draw and exposes `Trace.dumpText`; file-writing `Trace.dump` and `TraceModel.parseDump` are absent.
- **Development builds only.** A traced build is slower and allocates per event. Ship against the
  untraced `Ranvier` package.
- **The log retains events.** Events stay in memory for the graph's lifetime, up to the implementation's
  sequence limit. There is no eviction or checkpoint API.
- **Payloads retain values.** Writes, transitions and settlements can retain values or exceptions in
  event payloads. These are object references, not immutable historical snapshots: later mutation can
  affect their formatting. Retention can keep application objects alive for the log's lifetime.
- **Flights are async memo flights.** `waitingOn` lists the flights of an `AsyncMemo`. An
  `AsyncSource` has no flights: its settles appear as `Settle` and `Fail` events.
- **Combinator nodes carry the site of the combinator call.** Rows and internal nodes of `filter`,
  `sortBy` and the other views share the call's file and line, told apart by `#n`, not by key.
- **Sites follow the JIT.** An inlined method can report its caller's line. `Trace.named` is the
  stable name. The repository's trace gates run with `DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0`.
- **Dumps run between flushes, on the graph thread.** `Trace.dump` and `Trace.dumpText` raise
  `InvalidOperationException` off the graph's thread or inside a flush, a discharge or a
  computation's run. Inside `batch` they succeed. The queries run at any time on the graph thread.
- **Trace locking is not graph synchronization.** The event log serializes recording, but
  `ThreadAffinity = Unchecked` does not make graph operations safe to run concurrently. The caller must
  still serialize graph access; async event order can differ between runs.
- **Labels are names, not keys.** Nodes sharing a label under one owner are told apart by creation
  order: the second takes `#1`, the third `#2`.

:::

## How the zero-cost claim is checked

:::details Verification gates for trace changes

The repository provides `tools/verify-trace.fsx` to check trace changes:

- The untraced Release IL references no trace type and equals the IL of the merge base, method by
  method. The packed DLL's public surface equals a committed baseline plus `Trace.named` and
  `Trace.label`.
- A sample using `Trace.named` or `Trace.label` compiles to the same IL as the sample without it.
- The traced test suite passes, and a sample dump is byte-identical over five runs.
- For each counter-bench scenario, the log's run, edge, observer and flush counts equal the
  library's own counters, and the edges folded from the log equal the live graph.
- With elevated rights, the counter bench shows equal allocations and instruction counts between
  the merge base and the change.
